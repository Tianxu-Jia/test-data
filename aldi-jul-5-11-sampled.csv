The supermarket chain said the move will see 60 core fresh produce, meat and dairy products cut in price by the end of the month.  It is the latest step in the retailer’s plan to “put food back at the heart of the business” and focus on improving value amid continued competition for customers from German discount rivals Aldi and Lidl.  It also comes after Sainsbury’s launched its Aldi Price Match scheme earlier this year to reduce the price of hundreds of items.  Sainsbury’s shoppers will see reductions on essential items such as meat and fresh produce (Jacob King/PA)  Sainsbury’s said the latest round of price cuts will land this week, covering everyday essentials including chicken, bacon, herbs and potatoes.  Around 43 items will be reduced on July 7, with a raft of further reductions taking the total of 60 by the end of the month.  The retailer added that its current Aldi Price Match and Price Lock are “already making a significant difference and getting a good early response from customers”.  Rhian Bartlett, Sainsbury’s food commercial director, said: “Now more than ever we know we need to do more to deliver the great quality customers expect from Sainsbury’s, at great prices.  “It’s our mission to help everyone eat better and these price reductions are the latest step to show how serious we are about delivering on this promise to customers.  “Including everyday items and recipe essentials, we hope this will help shoppers save on their groceries and enjoy the month ahead.”  Sainsbury’s has seen strong sales over the past year as it remained open during coronavirus lockdowns.  Sales for the 12 months to March jumped by 7.8%, although the business dropped to £261 million loss for the year after it was impacted by £485 million in Covid related costs.

Retailers Woolworths and Coles are the nation's most trusted brands, a new survey reveals.   Australia's two largest supermarket brands came out on top in 2021, according to the latest Roy Morgan Risk Report released on Monday.   Data scientists surveyed more than 20,000 Australians to identify the nation's 20 most trusted and distrusted brands.   They found supermarkets, led by Woolworths, Coles, Bunnings and then Aldi dominated the list of trusted brands amid the pandemic, which led to a retail sales boom on the back of record government support for the economy.   Roy Morgan CEO Michele Levine said the essential nature of these businesses kept them “front and centre” for Aussies who have been prevented from engaging in many activities deemed non-essential.   “Woolworths and Coles have both moved up the trust league ladder during the Covid period with their supply of food and drink (and toilet paper) keeping the economy moving, and households well-stocked, during several lockdowns which forced the closure of other retailers for sometimes months on end,” Ms Levine said.   Bunnings Warehouse and ALDI also kept their high standings in third and fourth place respectively, as Bunnings stayed open during lockdown as an essential business supplying goods and materials to trades and the building industry.   Kmart also jumped three spots from its pre-pandemic to sixth overall.   Other companies that excelled when it came to trustworthiness included Apple - which jumped 78 places to come seventh overall, rubbing shoulders with Toyota in eight position and Qantas in fifth in the top 10 most trusted brands.   However, when it came to brands Australians trusted the least, Amazon, Rio Tinto and Huawei made the top 10 for the first time.   Other brands such as Crown Resorts, Uber, Twitter and TikTok were also in the top 20 of the most distrusted brands, many of which had endured negative publicity in recent times.   “A look at the new brands to enter the top 20 most distrusted brands list reveals a litany of missteps and controversies over the last year including Rio Tinto's destruction of the 46,000 year old Juukan indigenous heritage site, concerns about Chinese government influence for Huawei and Tiktok and legal and licensing problems for Crown Resorts related to the facilitation of large-scale money laundering,” Ms Levine said.   Major banks NAB, ANZ and CBA managed to improve their rankings, with all three dropping out of the top 10 least trusted brands.   Ms Levine said distrust remained the biggest risk factor for companies, which needed to take heed of public sentiment.   The report's release came as Australian retail turnover rose 0.4 per cent in May 2021, seasonally adjusted, based on final retail trade figures issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Monday.

New York-headquartered Apollo Global Management, which last year missed out on buying Morrisons rival Asda, said it was in the preliminary stages of evaluating a possible offer but had not approached its board.  Private equity groups have embarked on a spending spree on assets around the world in the last six months, flush with cash after they largely sat out the pandemic. Morrisons, set up 122 years ago as a market stall in northern England, is a target.  Morrisons said on Saturday that its board, led by Chairman Andrew Higginson, had recommended a takeover led by SoftBank owned Fortress Investment Group that valued the grocer at 6.3 billion pounds ($8.7 billion).  The offer from Fortress, along with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Koch Real Estate Investments, exceeded a 5.52 billion pound unsolicited proposal from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), which Morrisons rejected on June 19.  However, it was less than the 6.5 billion pounds asked for by top 10 Morrisons investor JO Hambro last week.  Fortress' offer gives Morrisons an enterprise value of 9.5 billion pounds when including net debt of 3.2 billion pounds.  Its shares were up 11.2% at 267 pence at 0935 GMT - ahead of the 254 pence value of the Fortress deal, indicating investors expect higher offers to be made. Morrisons declined to comment on Apollo's statement.  Analysts have speculated that other private equity groups and Amazon, which has a longstanding supplier deal with Morrisons, could also bid. Amazon has declined to comment.  While Britain has always been a key destination in Europe for private equity investments, the volumes have peaked this year as Brexit and sterling weakness coupled with the coronavirus crisis to hit company valuations.  Like its peers Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, Morrisons enjoyed a surge in sales in the last 18 months, as hospitality was forced to shut, but the cost of ramping up online delivery hit profits.  Ultimately, its fate will be decided by its shareholders.  As things currently stand there is only one firm bid on the table and investors will vote on the Fortress deal.  Morrisons' three biggest investors Silchester, Blackrock and Columbia Threadneedle, which Refinitiv data showed having stakes of 15.2%, 9.6% and 9.4% respectively, are effectively the kingmakers. None has commented so far.  Under UK takeover rules Fortress' offer effectively resets the clock for CD&R to clarify its intentions, with a previous date of July 17 extended to around the end of the month.  The Takeover Panel is yet to announce the deadline by which Apollo must clarify its intentions.  ""254p now seems to be the likely minimum and we would not rule out the eventual price rising further,"" said analysts at Barclays.  APPETITE FOR GROCERS  Barclays said CD&R could pay more than the agreed offer from Fortress, pointing out that CD&R has a bigger UK retail footprint than Fortress as it owns the Motor Fuels Group petrol forecourt chain. Also CD&R might be able to bid more if sale and leasebacks of Morrisons stores form part of its plan.  Fortress has ruled out material sales and says it likes to empower existing management teams - an approach that could prove popular with the government after the pandemic showed the importance of retaining food production locally.  Morrisons owns 85% of its nearly 500 stores and has 19 mostly freehold manufacturing sites. It is unique among British supermarkets in making over half of the fresh food it sells.  After years of grappling with the German discount rivals Aldi and Lidl, British supermarkets are once again attractive because of their cash generation and freehold assets. The funds believe the stock market is not recognising the grocers' value in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Morrisons started out as an egg and butter merchant in 1899 and was built up over 55 years by the late Ken Morrison, the son of the founder.  Last year Apollo lost out on buying Asda to brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa and TDR Capital. That deal valued Asda at 6.8 billion pounds.  Shares in Tesco and Sainsbury's were up 1.5% and 1.9% respectively with speculation swirling that they could also attract approaches. Both companies declined to comment.  In April, Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky raised his stake in Sainsbury's to almost 10%, igniting bid speculation.  Apollo says its private equity business had more than $89 billion in assets under management by the end of March 2021, in 150 companies such as Watches of Switzerland, TMT group Endemol Shine, bookmaker Ladbrokes Coral and Norwegian Cruise Line.

The supermarket chain said the move will see 60 core fresh produce, meat and dairy products cut in price by the end of the month.  Price reduced ‘for the foreseeable’  The retailer said that these new reduced prices would remain in place “for the foreseeable”, and that customers can expect to make savings of up to 25 per cent on many items.  The price reduction will be applied to 60 popular items, including fresh produce, meat and dairy products. Initially around 43 items will be reduced on 7 July, with more items then being reduced throughout the month.  The £50 million price investment is the latest move in Sainsbury’s bid to offer better value for customers, following the launch of its Sainsbury’s Quality, Aldi Price Match commitment.  ‘Delivering great quality’  Rhian Bartlett, Sainsbury’s Food Commercial Director, said: “Now more than ever we know we need to do more to deliver the great quality customers expect from Sainsbury’s, at great prices.  “It’s our mission to help everyone eat better and these price reductions are the latest step to show how serious we are about delivering on this promise to customers.  “Including everyday items and recipe essentials, we hope this will help shoppers save on their groceries and enjoy the month ahead.”  The items being reduced  Sainsbury’s says that these are examples of savings that customers can experience through July:  Sainsbury's Thick Smoked Cut Back Bacon Rashers x6 300g, was £2.05, now £1.50  Sainsbury's Brussels & Garlic Pate 170g, was £1.40, now £1  Sainsbury's Rhubarb 400g, was £1.50, now 95p  Sainsbury's Red Cabbage Loose, was 80p, now 45p  Sainsbury's White Cabbage Loose, was 80p, now 45p  Sainsbury's Sweet Potato 1.25k, was £1.50, now £1.11  Sainsbury's Baking Potatoes 2.5kg, was £2, now £1.19  Sainsbury's Red & White Seedless Grapes 500g, was £2, now £1.59  Sainsbury's Strawberries 400g, was £1.75, now £1.59  Sainsbury's Fresh Packed Mint 30g, was 75p, now 47p  These are just some of the products that will see a reduction in price, with more actually included.

In 1956, William’s son, Ken Morrison, took over the operations of the small network of grocery stores that by that time bore the Morrisons name across the nearby Yorkshire towns, and it was his business acumen that took his father’s hard work into the massive empire that it is today.  For those who remember Morrisons’ foray out of Yorkshire which was greeted by amusing stereotype images of bags of coal for sale or a delicatessen counter that sold only pies when the first Morrisons supermarket that made its way south of Watford Gap Services on the M1 opened in Letchworth Garden City, it is no longer a laughing matter.  Morrisons is now the subject of a fierce bidding war as large institutions fight to buy it at multi-billion-pound sums.  Last week, it was assumed a done deal when the company came under acquisition talks from US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice which wanted to buy Morrisons for a princely £5.5 billion, however since then, many more potential acquirers have got in on the action, resulting in an almost auction-like stand-off between potential investors.  Over the weekend, SoftBank -backed Fortress Investment struck a £6.3 billion deal to buy Morrisons, resulting in a massive rise in share price of over 28 points this morning to 266.8p. That’s an astronomical 11.23%.  It’s also a five-year high.  Confidence by investors has been massaged by Morrisons’ fortuitous position of being able to turn down massive offers as others materialize, and as a result, two weeks ago, the company’s share price rose by 35%, and has been steadily going up since.  Today’s rocketing value as a superior deal was sealed is further testimony to that.  As Omar has sung in 1993, It ain’t over till it’s over, and this is certainly the case today as Fortress’ bid of £6.3 billion is looking set to be challenged by another private equity firm, this time Apollo, which has admitted that it is considering a higher bid.  Apollo became the third potential suitor to declare an interest in Morrisons, announcing to the stock exchange on Monday that it was “in the preliminary stages of evaluating a possible offer for Morrisons”, in a move that could trump a £6.3bn bid by a consortium led by the US investment fund Fortress, the owner of Majestic Wine.  Whether any of these bids will result in a signed and sealed acquisition is yet to be known, particularly considering that Morrisons has a history of failed takeover bids behind it, however this time it is very different in that potential acquirers are literally tripping over themselves to outbid each other.  For example, in February 2014, it emerged that younger members of the founding Morrison family, who owned 10% of the company and who were thought to include two of Honorary President Sir Ken Morrison’s children, William Morrison Junior and Andrea Shelley, along with Sir Ken Morrison’s niece and her husband, Susan and Nigel Pritchard, had approached a number of private equity firms about taking the company private.  They were said to be extremely unhappy about the company’s disastrous financial performance, and the corporate strategy being undertaken by Dalton Philips.  At that time, straight-talking Yorkshireman Sir Ken Morrison blasted Dalton Philips and his new board of directors for destroying the company he inherited from his father. Sir Ken remarked disdainfully on Philips’s strategy to save the failing supermarket from the pressures of Aldi and other discounter stores.  Following on in this bold as brass tradition, Morrisons continued as a publicly listed firm and when the latest round of acquisition attempts approached it, the firm rejected Clayton, Dubilier and Rice’s £5.5 billion bid, deeming it to “significantly undervalue” the company, leading to a host of other bids that we now see.  Morrisons has a lot of freehold property, and some analysts think that private equity firms could be showing this much interest in Morrisons partly because of its property portfolio, which they would ‘sale and leaseback’ to generate cash to pay back to themselves.  With sensationalist mainstream media having touted that ‘Morrisons has been sold to Americans’ over the weekend, only to wake up this morning and find that it has not yet been sold and there are more bids, volatility is being stoked.  Will it sell and continue to show high share price rises, or will all talks fail and the share price go down to its relatively low level?  All currently hangs in the balance.

The supermarket giant has said it will invest £50 million into the price of its products in a move which will make dozens of popular items cheaper for shoppers.   Price reductions on 60 core fresh produce, meat and dairy products will kick in from today (Tuesday, July 6).   The retailer said that these new reduced prices would remain in place “for the foreseeable”, and that customers can expect to make savings of up to 25 per cent on many items.   The price reduction will be applied to 60 popular items, including fresh produce, meat and dairy products. Initially around 43 items will be reduced on 6 July, with more items then being reduced throughout the month.   The £50 million price investment is the latest move in Sainsbury's bid to offer better value for customers, following the launch of its Sainsbury's Quality, Aldi Price Match commitment.   Rhian Bartlett, Sainsbury's Food Commercial Director, said: “Now more than ever we know we need to do more to deliver the great quality customers expect from Sainsbury's, at great prices.   “It's our mission to help everyone eat better and these price reductions are the latest step to show how serious we are about delivering on this promise to customers.   “Including everyday items and recipe essentials, we hope this will help shoppers save on their groceries and enjoy the month ahead.”   Sainsbury's says that these are examples of savings that customers can experience through July:   These are just some of the products that will see a reduction in price, with more actually included.

They tell you crap jokes.  They tell you they once scored a goal for Cork when they were ace footballers.  They tell you about their gout and their heart problems.  And they tell you just how much they value and love the ‘fun bus’.  “If I couldn’t get on the bus, I’d be a prisoner in my own home.”  “I’d be knackered if I couldn’t get the bus, get to Aldi or get to the bookies.”  Chris Connolly, the assistant on the Youghal Community Bus, which is marking its tenth anniversary, loves his job.  “The people on the bus put me in a good mood every single day I meet them,” says Youghal man Chris, who dressed up as a woman to take part in the Cork virtual mini-marathon last year.  “ I raised funds for the bus by going up and down the town of Youghal, ending up at Lidl, one of our generous sponsors,” says Chris.  “The response was great. I was like a child running up and down the town!”  In high heels?  “No,” says Chris, smiling. “I had my runners on. I did my own mini-marathon! People commented on my calves! I got lots of compliments. It was great cráic!”  The cráic on the fun bus is great too.  “I often have to help people on and off the bus,” says Chris.  “And I assist them carrying their shopping home, helping them into their homes. They say that’s the only ‘cuddle’ they get all day! We enjoy the banter.  “The people on the bus all know each other and the group is like our own little social club. We swap jokes and tell stories and we have a really fun time.”  Chris has made life-long friends on the fun bus since he began working on it through a Secad scheme in 2019, and now as a volunteer.  “It’s good for my health and for my mental health,” he says. “I’ve met really nice people.”  He’s lost some nice people along the way.  “Of course, we miss all those who have sadly passed,” says Chris, “including Lesley Cullinane, a former director of Youghal Community Bus, who tragically died last year at a young age. We all miss Lesley.”  Where do the passengers on the bus go when they are picked up at their door?  “A lot of them go shopping to do their weekly shop,” says Chris.  “One or two may want to go to the GP or pick up a prescription at the chemist. Often people visit a friend or relative and go for a cup of coffee or some lunch.  “They call us during the week to book in and we collect them at their door and drop them back again to their door. They say they enjoyed a lovely day out.”  How did the fun bus get going?  “Ten years ago, Tony Phelan, a former director, broached the idea of a community bus,” says Michael Beecher, present director and former member of Youghal Town Council.  “Tony had a son with a disability and the bus was Tony’s brainchild. We thought it was a great idea.  ""Youghal is full of housing estates and it is full of hills. Older people or those with a disability may find it difficult to get in and out of town.  “Getting the community bus on the road seemed like a great opportunity to address any issues like this for people.”  The community bus is a bus for the people.  “The bus belongs to the people of Youghal,” says Michael. “They contribute towards a fare and those contributions help run the bus.  “Youghal businesses have been really generous with sponsorship over the years. We’ve kept the bus running because of their amazing generosity.”  Everybody benefits because of the fun bus.  “People who come on the bus for work experience really enjoy it,” says Michael. “And it gives them a great understanding of dealing with people and an appreciation of life.”  Shy people come out of their shell.  “You might get shy lads on board,” says Michael. “That soon changes!”  Covid didn’t stop the fun bus either.  “We had half passenger capacity and the driver and assistant were screened off. Sanitiser was used upon boarding the bus.  “Some people were terrified and didn’t travel on the bus during Covid; unfortunately, they were more isolated as a result. But now, things are returning to normal.”  The fun bus is back — and so is the craic.  “The jolliness on the bus is back big time,” says Michael. “Our regulars have become members. They sign an application form to become a member.”  How is one eligible to join the ‘jolly club’?  “People over 60 can apply and people with a disability or with mobility issues can apply to become a member,” says Michael. “The bus is for the people of Youghal. It belongs to them.”  Was he always a member of the ‘jolly club’?  “I was in the coal business,” says Michael. “Then I got a health scare and had to change tack.” But he never took a back seat.  “I was voted in to the town council numerous times over the years,” says Michael. “Being involved in community affairs is great.”  The camaraderie on the fun bus is great.  “People get a great kick out of the sociability it,” says Michael.  Everyone gets on board.  “We have a wonderful committee,” says Michael. “Tony is still with us as PR. We miss Lesley Cullinane. She was a great lady. It was such a shock to all of us when she died last summer.”  Michael, like the fun bus, is still going strong.  “Aboard the bus, we have a great bit of fun,” he says.  “We sing songs, and tell yarns, some of which I can’t repeat! There’s a lot of double-meaning involved.”  Please tell me one of those stories.  “When we meet again maybe,” says Michael conspiratorially. He adds: “Things are returning to normal. The bus is up and running every day. Now we are 10 years old, we are seeking charity status and hope to expand our services offering wheelchair access to facilitate wheel-chair users.”  Michael and his crew are proud of the bus that provides a great service and sociability.  “The service is unique to Youghal,” says Michael.  “We are all friends and we are all delighted to have the bus on the road.”  Margaret Carey, one of the bus regulars, said: “I use the bus on Thursdays to go into town. It is a pleasure to get on it. It is so handy because I don’t drive and I don’t want to keep asking my husband to drive me. We all help each other out on the bus. I’ve known all the drivers since I began using it when I was 60. I’m 69 now! They were all lovely. We have great fun and a good laugh. It is a community bus.  “I know a man who lived in the UK since the 1950s. When he came back to Youghal; he saw so many changes. The driver on the Community Bus took him all around the town pointing out new businesses and new places. The man was delighted!” ",uncredited,25899-219325,Regional News,Web,,Echo Live,Echo Live,https://www.echolive.ie,2021-07-06 07:42:33,https://www.echolive.ie/corklives/arid-40330361.html,Europe,Western Europe,Ireland,,en,256406,,21,6,Positive,0,,,1,,,,1,Article is about a bus service,0.5,50,1,6.6,56.6540195066896

The Prime Minister announced all legal lockdown restrictions will end, including mask-wearing, social distancing and nightclub closures at Step 4 of the Government's plan to ease England's lockdown.   The so-called “freedom day” is expected on July 19, with a decision on whether or not to go ahead being taken a week earlier.   Despite the positive news concerning the end of lockdown, Mr Johnson was eager to stress that the coronavirus pandemic is “far from over”.   He told the Downing Street press conference: “We're seeing rising hospital admissions and we must reconcile ourselves sadly to more deaths from Covid.   “In these circumstances we must take a careful and a balanced decision. And there's only one reason why we can contemplate going ahead to step four in circumstances where we'd normally be locking down further, and that's because of the continuing effectiveness of the vaccine rollout.”   Although lockdown is expected to end in England on July 19, Mr Johnson warned there is potential for the daily count of coronavirus cases to be at 50,000 each day by that date.   Professor Chris Whitty warned that the winter “may be very difficult” for the NHS.   England's chief medical officer told the Downing Street press conference: “The winter is inevitably going to be tricky and this winter the NHS is likely to have both Covid and some resurgence of other respiratory viruses that were suppressed by the degree of lockdown last time round.   “So, I think we should be realistic and this coming winter may be very difficult for the NHS.”   Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned there are no guarantees when facing questions from Labour in Commons on Monday.   He said: ""There's no absolutely risk-free way to move forward but we do need to start returning things back towards normal and learning to live with Covid.""

The boss explained: “We’re all absorbing the latest news last night and thinking through our response.  Sainsbury’s boss Simon Roberts says mask-wearing will be a personal choice (Andrew Porter Commercial Photography/Sainsburys/PA)  “There are two very distinct points of view. One is customers and colleagues who can’t wait for the restrictions to lift and not to have to wear a mask for example, and others who are keen to continue to do that.  “I think in the end it will come down to the choices that individual customers and colleagues want to make. It is going to be driven by customer and by colleague choice.”  He added: “We’re clearly going to follow the Government advice, we’ll continue to listen to our customers and colleagues and we’ll respect and support the individual choices the customers and colleagues want to make.”  Chief medical officer Chris Whitty said on Monday he would continue wearing a mask “in any situation that was indoors and was crowded, or indoors and in close proximity to other people”.  Mr Roberts’ comments come as the boss said sales were better than expected in the last three months.  He said households appeared to stay at home to eat rather than head off to restaurants and cafes, despite Covid-19 restrictions easing.  In the 16 weeks to June 26, sales were up 1.6% compared with the same period a year ago – which was at the height of the first wave and when shelves were stripped bare with panic-buying.  City analysts had expected to see a fall of around 4.1%.  Sales at Argos took a hit, however, down 3.7%, as the stocking-up on home office equipment a year earlier created tough comparisons.  Online sales remained strong, with 18% of all food now sold through Sainsbury’s website compared with 8% pre-pandemic.  Online sales were up 29% on a year ago and 142% on a two-year comparison.  The supermarket was also boosted by England’s performance in the Euro 2020 championship, with Mr Roberts saying sales of beer were 60% higher last Saturday than on a typical weekend.  This equated to 17 packs of beer sold every second, he said.  But despite the impressive performance, the supermarket sector is under pressure due to rising costs, an HGV driver shortage and a flurry of takeover speculation, with Morrisons in the mist of a bidding war.  Mr Roberts said Sainsbury’s has not received any approaches for the chain, although he suggested the sector is undervalued by investors.  On inflation, he said there were some signs of prices creeping up on certain products – highlighting increased soy prices and grains – but fresh food is falling in price.  He also pointed out that from Tuesday, the supermarket is launching its latest salvo in a price war with discounters Aldi and Lidl, reducing prices by £50 million on everyday products.  But he admitted cost pressures were coming from supply chain issues, saying: “The impacts on freight and logistics, there are inflationary pressures there.”  Supermarkets and suppliers have reported shortages of drivers and pent-up demand causing delays. Last week, sweets maker Haribo said it was struggling to get products to the UK due to the shortage.  Mr Roberts said certain products were missing from shelves but they were working hard on filling empty slots.

Simon Roberts said he would consult with staff on their views but said the decision to wear one would be down to individual choice.   The boss explained: “We're all absorbing the latest news last night and thinking through our response.   Sainsbury's boss Simon Roberts says mask-wearing will be a personal choice (Andrew Porter Commercial Photography/Sainsburys/PA)   “There are two very distinct points of view. One is customers and colleagues who can't wait for the restrictions to lift and not to have to wear a mask for example, and others who are keen to continue to do that.   “I think in the end it will come down to the choices that individual customers and colleagues want to make. It is going to be driven by customer and by colleague choice.”   He added: “We're clearly going to follow the Government advice, we'll continue to listen to our customers and colleagues and we'll respect and support the individual choices the customers and colleagues want to make.”   Chief medical officer Chris Whitty said on Monday he would continue wearing a mask “in any situation that was indoors and was crowded, or indoors and in close proximity to other people”.   Mr Roberts' comments come as the boss said sales were better than expected in the last three months.   He said households appeared to stay at home to eat rather than head off to restaurants and cafes, despite Covid-19 restrictions easing.   In the 16 weeks to June 26, sales were up 1.6% compared with the same period a year ago – which was at the height of the first wave and when shelves were stripped bare with panic-buying.   City analysts had expected to see a fall of around 4.1%.   Sales at Argos took a hit, however, down 3.7%, as the stocking-up on home office equipment a year earlier created tough comparisons.   Online sales remained strong, with 18% of all food now sold through Sainsbury's website compared with 8% pre-pandemic.   Online sales were up 29% on a year ago and 142% on a two-year comparison.   The supermarket was also boosted by England's performance in the Euro 2020 championship, with Mr Roberts saying sales of beer were 60% higher last Saturday than on a typical weekend.   This equated to 17 packs of beer sold every second, he said.   But despite the impressive performance, the supermarket sector is under pressure due to rising costs, an HGV driver shortage and a flurry of takeover speculation, with Morrisons in the mist of a bidding war.   Mr Roberts said Sainsbury's has not received any approaches for the chain, although he suggested the sector is undervalued by investors.   On inflation, he said there were some signs of prices creeping up on certain products – highlighting increased soy prices and grains – but fresh food is falling in price.   He also pointed out that from Tuesday, the supermarket is launching its latest salvo in a price war with discounters Aldi and Lidl, reducing prices by £50 million on everyday products.   But he admitted cost pressures were coming from supply chain issues, saying: “The impacts on freight and logistics, there are inflationary pressures there.”   Supermarkets and suppliers have reported shortages of drivers and pent-up demand causing delays. Last week, sweets maker Haribo said it was struggling to get products to the UK due to the shortage.   Mr Roberts said certain products were missing from shelves but they were working hard on filling empty slots.   Sainsbury's sales were up but its Argos business took a knock against tough comparisons (Michael McHugh/PA)   He explained: “If you go into our stores today what you would find is that we are getting products to store, but not necessarily every product.   “There are challenges throughout the supply chain. We're working really hard with our partners and with suppliers across the wider industry and with government.”   One area of deliveries that is not struggling is Sainsbury's on-demand service, Chop Chop, which is now available in 49 stores, offering the arrival of orders in 60 minutes.   The grocer also said it now has 230 stores offering services on Uber Eats and Deliveroo – up 42 stores compared with March.   Sainsbury's also saw growth in sales of its Tu clothing range as more shoppers looked to buy outfits to take advantage of easing Covid-19 restrictions.   Clothes sales rose 57.6% compared with a year earlier.

French champagne producers are fiercely jealous of the AOC -- or Appellation of Controlled Origin -- that is supposed to give them exclusive use of the word in countries that adhere to the Lisbon Agreement on distinctive geographical indications.  But Russia is not a signatory, and President Vladimir Putin signed a law last week that will forbid the use of the Russian translation of champagne -- ""Shampanskoye"" -- on imported bottles.  French producers can still use the word in French, but will also have to write ""sparkling wine"" in Cyrillic on the back of bottles -- a heresy for brands that say nothing on Earth can match their distinctive bubbly.  ""Denying the Champenois the right to use the name 'champagne' in Cyrillic is scandalous: it is our common heritage and the apple of our eye,"" Maxime Toubart and Jean-Marie Barillere, co-presidents of France's Champagne Committee, said in a statement.  Though Russia may not be the world's biggest champagne market -- it ranks 15th in terms of the number of champagne bottles it imports -- it's an important one because Russians tend to buy expensive bottles.  The committee, which groups grape growers and producers in France's Champagne region, also called on diplomats to push for a change of the ""unacceptable law"", and urged their members to halt all shipments to Russia until further notice.  It was unclear if their appeal would be heeded.  Moet Hennessy, owned by the luxury conglomerate LVMH, already said Sunday that it would comply with the law and would resume exports of its brands, including Dom Perignon, Moet & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot, ""as soon as possible"".  - Cigarettes, perfume and sorbet -  Story continues  The Champagne Committee said the new law ""calls into question more than 20 years of bilateral talks between the European Union and Russia on the protection of AOCs"". It railed against Russia for not informing producers in advance of the change and said it is ""determined to pursue discussions with the Russian authorities to obtain the exclusive right to the champagne name"". Launched in 1937 under Joseph Stalin, the ""Sovetskoye Shampanskoye"" brand aimed to make the elite bourgeois drink acceptable for the proletariat. Similarly, several Soviet republics created their own cognac, or ""konyak"". Such drinks were produced en mass and sold at affordable prices, but they were recognised as being pale imitations of the real French products. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the ""shampanskoye"" label persisted, which began to pose problems for Russia, especially after it joined the World Trade Organization in 2012. It remains synonymous today with a festive but cheap drink. According to the association of Russian makers of sparkling wines, total output can reach 220 million bottles per year, the bulk of which use a very different production method from the one used in France. As suggested by the term AOC, the right to label a product is restricted to those made in the region. Champagne makers also have to follow strict production methods. It's a name that champagne makers have been battling to protect since 1843. And the fight has not just been about using the name on sparkling wine. They've worked to block a whole range of unrelated products from trying to profit from champagne's reputation, from cigarettes to an Yves Saint Laurent perfume. Most recently they won a case against German supermarket chain Aldi over a champagne-flavoured sorbet, not because it violated the AOC, but because it was deemed untruthful as the dessert was judged to not taste of champagne. It's a battle many in France will continue fighting ""without fail"", Trade Minister Franck Riester said on Twitter. ""We're following closely the implications of this new Russian wine law together."" ngu/rl/jv ","Nicolas Gubert, Romain Colas",104858-823049,Regional News,Web,,Yahoo New Zealand News,Yahoo New Zealand News,https://nz.news.yahoo.com,2021-07-06 10:49:53,https://nz.news.yahoo.com/battle-bubbly-french-champagne-makers-102050271.html,Oceania,,New Zealand,,en,98308,,-30,4,Negative,1,,,,1,,,,,0.5,25,1,3.85,6.91555715684492

For the second time, it is the voice of Nina Horowitz who asks the candidates from the beginning about past and possible future partnerships. “The criticism last year was positive from all sides,” said the presenter, who took over the program after the death of creator Elisabeth T. Spira.  Personalities from all over Austria looking for a partner  Nine episodes will be broadcast on Mondays at 20:15, the tenth, which will be shown in the balance sheet, will run after a break on October 27. As usual, personalities from all over Austria stand in front of the camera in the first episode, which was presented to journalists on Monday night.  There’s Susanna from Vienna, who loves horror movies and would have liked to be a mortician (“But I came to the sausage department at an early age”), pensioner and nudist Charly from Styria, whose great love died young and chimney sweep Guido from Upper Austria whose first Mrs. cheated.  Quick clips, funny music in “love stories and marriage issues”  The cuts are a bit faster than in Spira’s time, a successful selection of music – “Wild Thing” is played on Weightlifter Guido – characterizes the show. Horowitz also chooses many songs himself and makes sure that each line of text matches the image. As usual, the camera always detects the features of every living room and bedroom – from the amber doll to the loving messages from the little son.  Represents life: Represents many social classes and sexual identities  ORF 2 wanted to portray all areas of general interest and life, said channel manager Alexander Hofer. “There are different, fine candidates from all federal states,” said program director Kathrin Zechner. Many social classes and sexual identities should be there, so there are also three gay men and a trans man during the season.  To take away their nervousness, Horowitz greeted the main characters with humor: “I think people feel I mean good to them.” Also, keep them on an equal footing with them and do not judge. It worked well last year – 15 people found a partner through the show.  Nina Horowitz has become more carefree after success  “Love Stories and Marriage Issues” reached an average of 952,000 viewers with its 24th season. Horowitz himself has also become more carefree after the success: “It was never a quota discussion about ORF,” she said, “but you put a little on yourself. When it worked, it was liberating for all of us.”  The presenter, who learned to conduct interviews with the news magazine “Profil” and the series of reports “Am Schauplatz”, meanwhile sees the program as a separate project. It should therefore continue in 2022, candidates are already being sought for next season.  “Love stories and marriage are important” Mondays from 12 July to 6 September and Wednesday 27 October at 20:15 at ORF 2.

After first launching in Siberia back in 2008, the chain has since expanded to countries including Italy and Spain.   “Some will understand us, some won't.   “There are already 30 businesses that will fill 70 percent of our shops.”   Each store in the UK will be around 10,000 sq ft, including a walk-in chiller room and a huge freezer to allow multi-temperature ranges to be sold from the pallet they arrive on.   Stores are said to also only have eight members of staff, a further effort to keep costs low.   Mere has said that in order to keep costs low, it will not use warehouses and deliveries will be delivered straight to stores.   In total, the discounter has said it wants to open around 300 sites in the UK within the next eight to ten years, although no other locations have been confirmed.   Although it claims to be cheaper than popular rivals Aldi and Lidl, prices won't be known until the store opens.   In May, Which? revealed that Lidl was the cheapest UK supermarket, costing just £22.66 for a basket of 20 essential items.   Aldi missed out on the top spot by just 40p, and it was the third time Lidl had taken the lead this year.   In other news, Sainsbury's has announced that 60 popular fresh produce, meat and dairy products will be on offer throughout the month of July and for the foreseeable future.   The investment follows Sainsbury's Aldi Price Match which sees many products comparable to that of the affordable German supermarket.   Sainsbury's has said that shoppers can make savings of up to 25 percent on many items.   Rhian Bartlett, Sainsbury's Food Commercial Director, said: “Now more than ever we know we need to do more to deliver the great quality customers expect from Sainsbury's, at great prices.   “It's our mission to help everyone eat better and these price reductions are the latest step to show how serious we are about delivering on this promise to customers.   “Including everyday items and recipe essentials, we hope this will help shoppers save on their groceries and enjoy this month ahead.” ",uncredited,262741-162862,Consumer,Web,,Usa Today Post,Usa Today Post,http://usatodaypost.com,2021-07-06 12:21:14,https://usatodaypost.com/russian-lidl-mere-starts-filling-shelves-as-new-discount-supermarket-prepares-to-open/,North America,,United States,,en,5490,,21,6,Positive,0,,,1,,,,1,About a new competing supermarket,2.5,19.047619047619,0.5,4.89761904761905,42.0408795545673

In the 16 weeks to June 26, sales were up 1.6 per cent compared with the same period a year ago - which was at the height of the first wave and when shelves were stripped bare with panic-buying. City analysts had expected to see a fall of around 4.1 per cent.  But sales at Argos took a hit, down 3.7 per cent, as the stocking-up on home office equipment a year earlier created tough comparisons.  Online sales remained strong, with 18 per cent of all food now sold through Sainsbury's website compared with 8 per cent pre-pandemic.  Online sales were up 29 per cent on a year ago and 142 per cent on a two-year comparison.  The supermarket was also boosted by England's performance in the Euro 2020 championship, with chief executive Simon Roberts saying sales of beer were 60 per cent higher last Saturday than on a typical weekend.  This equated to 17 packs of beer sold every second, he said.  But despite the impressive performance, the supermarket sector is under pressure due to rising costs, an HGV driver shortage and a flurry of takeover speculation, with Morrisons in the mist of a bidding war.  Mr Roberts said Sainsbury's has not received any approaches for the chain, although he suggested the sector is undervalued by investors.  On inflation, he said there were some signs of prices creeping up on certain products - highlighting increased soy prices and grains - but fresh food is falling in price.  He also pointed out that from Tuesday, the supermarket is launching its latest salvo in a price war with discounters Aldi and Lidl, reducing prices by £50 million on everyday products.  But he admitted cost pressures were coming from supply chain issues, saying: ""The impacts on freight and logistics, there are inflationary pressures there.""  Supermarkets and suppliers have reported shortages of drivers and pent-up demand causing delays. Last week, sweets maker Haribo said it was struggling to get products to the UK due to the shortage.  Mr Roberts said certain products were missing from shelves but they were working hard on filling empty slots.  Sainsbury's also saw growth in sales of its Tu clothing range as more shoppers looked to buy outfits to take advantage of easing Covid-19 restrictions.  Clothes sales rose 57.6 per cent compared with a year earlier.

But so far customers have been left in the dark about whether UK supermarkets are planning to scrap the rules.                   Brits currently face a fine of up to £6,400 for not wearing a mask in shops, but this legal obligation will be dropped from June 19.                                        Social distancing will not be required either, meaning supermarkets won’t legally have to restrict the number of customers in stores.                   This means queues outside shops, traffic light systems at the door and one way systems could be a thing of the past.                   However, individual businesses can make their own decision about whether to continue to enforce mask wearing and other Covid rules.                   In an statement outlining the next phase of the road map out of lockdown, the Prime Minister last night said firms can continue to require masks to be warn indoors.                   It is still recommended that people continue to wear face coverings in crowded spaces.                   Supermarkets are hedging their bets before announcing exactly what rules they will enforce from July 19.                    We will update this article with the latest announcements when we have more details.                   It is likely that they will make announcements closer to “freedom day”, with a further update from Boris Johnson expected on July 12.                   However, several major grocery chains said they are reviewing the latest guidance, suggesting they could be poised to remove the mask mandate.                   Sainsbury’s has indicated that it will let individual staff and customers decide whether to wear a mask.                   Chief executive Simon Roberts said: “We’re clearly going to follow the Government advice, we’ll continue to listen to our customers and colleagues and we’ll respect and support the individual choices [they] want to make.”                   In a statement the supermarket told The Sun that it is “reviewing the latest guidance and will keep customers and colleagues updated on our plans”.                   Lidl has also confirmed that it is “closely following government guidance”.                   “We are closely following government guidance regarding Covid-19 secure measures in our stores and will continue to do so in the coming weeks.”                   Morrisons said it is waiting for further government guidance before updating customers on what the rules will be after July 19.                   “We will then review them and update our policy accordingly,” a spokesperson said.

One lucky shopper will be chosen to do a five-minute trolley dash in store and take home all the products they can grab in that time, with Aldi donating the cash value of the trolley to a local foodbank. Run in accordance with current COVID-19 safety guidelines, the shopper will also be given a list of three Scottish products they need to find. If successful, Aldi will double the cash donation to the foodbank, and the savvy shopper will get to pick a Specialbuy item of their choice*.  One of the most enjoyable ways to get in your weekly shop, local residents can apply by filling out an online application form accessed via a QR code, which will be displayed in the Shettleston Road store from Monday 5th to Sunday 11th July.  Richard Holloway, Regional Managing Director for Scotland, said: “The Supermarket Sweep is a hugely popular event in the Aldi calendar, and we are thrilled to bring the competition back this year and offer one local Glasgow resident the chance to win a shopping experience like no other.  “We know how much foodbanks have struggled during the pandemic, and because we had to pause Supermarket Sweep last year, we’ve thought we’d offer to double the cash donation if contestants can find certain Scottish products during their dash around the store. From Elgin to Ayr and Inverness to Hawick, we hope to give as many people across Scotland as possible a chance to take part this year and raise as much money as we can for local foodbanks in the process.”  The Supermarket Sweep will be run in line with current COVID-19 guidelines and all safety precautions, including social distancing, will be adhered to. Shoppers will be asked to nominate their chosen foodbank when applying to take part. Entrants must be over 18 years old to take part and alcohol products are not included in the sweep. Before the sweep, the winner will be given a shopping list of three products and if they are successfully found, they will get to select a Specialbuy item of their choice. Aldi will also double the value of their trolley and donate it to the chosen local foodbank.  Entry for the competition is free and applications open from Monday 5th to Sunday 11th July. One lucky shopper will be selected and invited to take part in the event at the Shettleston Road store before Sunday 25th July. Entrants must be available to take part in the sweep after 10pm on their chosen date.

Bira was one of many leading retail names to write to the Prime Minister calling him to support an amendment to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that would tackle escalating violence and abuse against retail workers.  The letter was co-signed by the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS), the British Retail Consortium (BRC) as well as big name chains including Aldi, Asda, WH Smith, Waitrose, the Co-op Group, Sainsbury’s, Amazon, Asos, Tesco and Morrisons.  However, this part of the bill was yesterday (July 5, 2021) rejected - and won't be considered again until it goes to the House of Lords.  Andrew Goodacre, Bira's CEO, said: “This is so disappointing. Retailers, large and small, came together to present a very reasonable request and once again people in power are not listening.  ""All I can suggest is that these MPs work in a shop for a weekend to experience the issues at first hand!  ""We will continue to work with other organisations to achieve this legal change. In the grips of this pandemic these same MPs were very quick to call the retail worker ‘heroes’. It seems that appreciation was only short-lived.”  Bira has been fighting for better protection for retail staff.

Supplies of some non-food items has also been hit by global supply chain challenges caused by shortages of shipping containers, interruptions at factories and a shortfall in computer chips caused by surging demand for electronic equipment.   Simon Roberts, the Sainsbury's chief executive, said demand for soft drinks, beer and barbecue foods had all been stronger than expected in recent weeks as families continue to eat more at home and friends gather around their television sets to watch the Euro 2020 football tournament.   “As customers are spending more time together for the big events we have seen demand respond as a result,” he said.   Beer sales have surged 60% above normal levels since the tournament began, the UK's second largest supermarket group said, with Sainsbury's selling 17 packs of beer a second on Saturday as England fans stocked up for the quarter-final match against Ukraine.   Roberts said there had been problems with items such as salad packs and certain brands of beer and soft drink, and the company was “not getting every product through” because of driver shortages. But he said Sainsbury's was managing to bring in a range of different items so that “in areas that customers want to buy we have got availability”.   In an update on trading, Sainsbury's said it now expected to make annual profits of £660m, £40m more than previously forecast, as sales at established stores rose 1.6% year on year, excluding fuel, in the four months to 26 June.   That growth was underpinned by a 0.8% year-on-year rise in grocery sales, despite trading against a very strong period a year before when the nation was stockpiling food in the early days of the pandemic. Sales were 11.3% more than two years ago.   Online grocery sales rose 29% as many families who switched to ordering from home during the pandemic continued to do so. Sainsbury's said it had gained market share from its big rivals as it cut prices on key items and promised to match the prices of discounter Aldi on certain lines.   Clothing sales soared almost 58% as a return to socialising and work, as well as warm weather, led demand for new outfits.   “Sainsbury's faced an extremely hard act to follow in the past three months compared with a year ago when many people were panic buying in the early stages of the pandemic,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell.   “This makes it all the more impressive that the company has managed to chalk up growth for the period and confirms the attractions of a UK groceries space which was recently reflected in the multibillion-pound bid for Morrisons.”   Sign up to the daily Business Today email   Sales at the group's Argos chain were down 3.7% as demand for consumer electronics and gym equipment fell compared with a year ago when households were adjusting to lockdown living.   Sainsbury's share price rose less than 1% despite the profits upgrade. The chain had a strong run in recent days prompted by hopes it could be next in line for a private equity-led takeover bid after the £6.8bn buyout of Asda and a £6.3bn agreed offer for Morrisons at the weekend.   Roberts said the Sainsbury's management team was “absolutely committed to driving through the value we see in the business” and indicated there were no firm offers on the table for the group.   “If we had anything to update on we would be updating on it,” he said when asked if Sainsbury's was in talks with potential suitors.

In March 2020, the wholesaler allowed shoppers over the age of 60 and those who are immunocompromised to shop by themselves on weekdays from 9-10 a.m. because of the coronavirus pandemic. The special hours were also open to first responders, healthcare workers, and people who have disabilities.  When the shopping hour was first introduced, it was only offered two days a week. Costco quickly extended it to three days a week. In May 2020, Costco began offering the special shopping hour from Monday through Friday. Two months later, the store considered cutting the special hour back down to two days a week but decided to keep offering it every weekday as the number of cases surged across the country.  Costco said that the special shopping hour will stop on July 26 as all stores resume normal operations. Several locations in California and Hawaii will have slightly different hours for seniors until the end of the month.  Costco is not the first chain to eliminate special shopping hours. Trader Joe's recently axed the special hour at most of its locations across the country.  Walmart, Target, BJ's, and Aldi are still offering senior hours and have not indicated if or when they will phase them out.

0,Aldi,8957942546,consumer,2021-07-06,2021-07-06 18:53:02,opoint,"Amid champagne dispute, Russian winemaker doubts new law will boost local sales"," As controversy bubbles over a new Russian law requiring bottles of French champagne and other foreign fizz to have a reference to “sparkling wine” on the bottle, Russian winemaker Abrau-Durso said Tuesday that the law would do little to spur on sales of Russia's “shampanskoye”.   Champagne makers are used to having the prestigious name usurped by rival producers here and there, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has upped the ante by signing a law reserving the appellation for Russian sparkling wine, which has prompted a call for a bubbly blockade.   Pavel Titov, the president of Abrau-Durso and co-owner with his father, told Reuters that he did not believe the new law would change the level of competition in Russia's market.   “We are in completely different price segments – imported French champagne is many times more expensive,” he said.   Shares in Abrau-Durso, which last year renamed its “Russkoye shampanskoye” brand “Russkoye igristoe”, or Russian sparkling, were trading up 0.5 percent on the day on Tuesday and at one point almost 9 percent up since the start of the week.   Abrau-Durso exports its wines to 24 countries but not France, Titov said.   French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in parliament on Tuesday that France would react in the next few days to the Russian measure and that if it was found to be in violation of World Trade Organization rules, Paris would seek recourse.   French champagne producers are fiercely protective of the AOC – or Appellation of Controlled Origin – that is supposed to give them exclusive use of the word in countries that adhere to the Lisbon Agreement on distinctive geographical indications.   But Russia is not a signatory, and Putin signed a law last week that would forbid the use of “Shampanskoye” – the Russian translation of champagne – on imported bottles.   French producers can still use the word in French, but will also have to write “sparkling wine” in Cyrillic on the back of bottles – a heresy for brands that say nothing on Earth can match their distinctive bubbly.   Outrage in France   “Denying the Champenois the right to use the name ‘champagne' in Cyrillic is scandalous: it is our common heritage and the apple of our eye,” Maxime Toubart and Jean-Marie Barillère, co-presidents of France's Champagne Committee, said in a statement.   The committee, which groups grape growers and producers in France's Champagne region, also called on diplomats to push for a change of the “unacceptable law”, and urged their members to halt all shipments to Russia until further notice.   French Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie said Tuesday that “champagne” was a name that could only be used on sparkling wines from the eponymous region in France.   “You can imagine the reaction of the French authorities,” Denormandie told Sud Radio. “The word Champagne comes from that beautiful region of France where champagne is produced.”   Though Russia may not be the world's biggest champagne market – it ranks 15th in terms of the number of champagne bottles it imports – it's an important one because Russians tend to buy expensive bottles.   Titov told French media on Saturday he hoped the issue, which led some in the French champagne industry to urge producers to halt shipments to Russia, would be resolved in favour of global norms and standards.   Moët Hennessy, owned by the luxury conglomerate LVMH, said Sunday that it would comply with the law and would resume exports of its brands, including Dom Perignon, Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot, “as soon as possible”.   Cigarettes, perfume and sorbet   The Champagne Committee said the new law “calls into question more than 20 years of bilateral talks between the European Union and Russia on the protection of AOCs”.   It railed against Russia for not informing producers in advance of the change and said it is “determined to pursue discussions with the Russian authorities to obtain the exclusive right to the champagne name”.   Launched in 1937 under Joseph Stalin, the “Sovetskoye Shampanskoye” brand aimed to make the elite bourgeois drink acceptable for the proletariat.   Similarly, several Soviet republics created their own cognac, or “konyak”.   Such drinks were produced en masse and sold at affordable prices, but they were recognised as being pale imitations of the real French products.   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the “shampanskoye” label persisted, which began to pose problems for Russia, especially after it joined the World Trade Organization in 2012.   It remains synonymous today with a festive but cheap drink.   According to the association of Russian makers of sparkling wines, total output can reach 220 million bottles per year, the bulk of which use a very different production method from the one used in France.   As suggested by the term AOC, the right to label a product is restricted to those made in the region. Champagne makers also have to follow strict production methods.   It's a name that champagne makers have been battling to protect since 1843.   And the fight has not just been about using the name on sparkling wine.   They've worked to block a whole range of unrelated products from trying to profit from champagne's reputation, from cigarettes to an Yves Saint Laurent perfume.   Most recently they won a case against German supermarket chain Aldi over a champagne-flavoured sorbet, not because it violated the AOC, but because it was deemed untruthful as the dessert was judged to not taste of champagne.   It's a battle many in France will continue fighting “without fail”, Trade Minister Franck Riester said on Twitter.   “We're closely following the implications of this new Russian wine law together.”   (FRANCE 24 with AFP and REUTERS)   Denial of responsibility!

PureGym has welcomed its first gym-goers in Stowmarket following a huge revamp of the closed down Aldi store.   The site in Gipping Way was bought by Mid Suffolk District Council in 2018 in a bid to speed its regeneration, with national fitness chain PureGym converting the space into a 24-hour gym.   It will offer low price, no contract memberships, bringing affordable fitness into the local community.   The Stowmarket site comes complete with a functional zone, free weights, fixed resistance, cardio equipment and a fitness studio.   Councillor Peter Gould, Mid Suffolk District Council cabinet member for assets and investment, said attracting a strong national brand such as PureGym shows the town has a ""bright and positive future"".   ""Stowmarket already has a huge amount to offer to residents and visitors and the addition of PureGym builds on this and takes forward our ambition to improve the health and wellbeing of our citizens,"" he said.   The gym is situated in an easily accessible location with plenty of free parking, and has created seven new jobs.    .  Councillor Gerard Brewster cut the ribbon at the opening of PureGym in Stowmarket.

WHAT'S the iced snack of summer 2021? Forget Magnums and Haagen-Dazs, the country's most discerning freezers are stocked with mochi ice cream balls.   Yes, they're tasty, but better still, a mochi is a fraction of the calories of a good scoop of decent ice cream (on average 70-80 calories compared to 140 calories), and because of the intriguing chewy texture of their dough, just one bite-sized mochi can satisfy the most insistent ice cream cravings.   A Japanese treat, mochi ice-cream balls are made by wrapping a glutinous rice dough around Italian ice cream.   In Japan, mochi is nothing new. They were a popular snack during the Heian period (794-1185), when farmers ate them for stamina during the winter and samurai took them on military expeditions.   Traditionally, mochi filled with azuki red bean paste are accompanied by green tea, still the custom in Japan. But in Europe, the ice cream-filled version has become one of the pandemic's biggest success stories.   The obsession with the snacks started on TikTok, which is fast becoming a key driver for food trends. The video platform now has more than 15,000 mochithemed clips, many of which show mochi fans going frantic about shortages in shops.   One of the most popular brands, Little Moons, saw sales rise a staggering 2,113 per cent during the first half of this year.   Siblings Vivien and Howard Wong, who started the brand from their home kitchen ten years ago, say that two of their mochi balls are now consumed every second. The brand is launching three limited-edition flavours: candy-floss, Eton mess and even fish and chips.   In response to demand, Aldi and Lidl have now created their own brands.   Aldi has already rushed out the affordable Wao Mochi Balls (€3.50 for six) which come in tropical, mango and coconut flavours. They launched in Ireland last month and sold out but new stock is expected soon.   Taking to the Aldi Shoppers Facebook forum, customers have been sharing their excitement for the arrival of the irresistible dessert, which sold out in less than two weeks.   Rival supermarket Lidl has launched its Vitasia mochi balls in the UK and while it doesn't plan to sell them in Ireland this summer, it can be expected to follow Aldi next year.   F   EEDING the apparent appetite for all things mochi, London now has its first dedicated mochi bar, which opened at Soho's Japan Centre last month.   The ice cream-hued bar is stuffed with pastel coloured delicacies and though you might expect trendy TikTokers, it's normally packed with families treating themselves.   Head of pastry at the Japan Centre, Asha Fernando, believes the fact they source their ingredients directly from Japan gives their mochi an edge, and they are busy innovating with new mochi styles.   However, some of the most stylish mochi concoctions  challenging Laduree's dainty   French macarons as the new fashionista's favourite  come from Ai No Mochi.   Set up four years ago by former marketeer Kelly Yu and restaurateur Hayyan Choudhry, who met studying business at university, it specialises in handmade mochi with ganache and cheesecake fillings. Flavours include a divine vivid pink raspberry mochi with raspberry and coconut ripple, Sicilian pistachio cream and Biscoff plus Nutella, all exquisitely presented and decorated like handmade artisan chocolates.   What started as a side hustle has now become their full-time business, supplying fashion clients including Dior.   For those unfazed by less familiar ingredients and techniques, there's even a DIY mochi kit available from Box42Kits (etsy.com, €18.60)  surely the ultimate culinary oneupmanship gift.    .

A total of GBP1.825 million has been provided by Maven’s Investor Partners network alongside a further GBP775,000 from the Maven managed North East Development Capital Fund and the North East Innovation Fund, supported by the European Regional Development Fund and managed by Northstar Ventures, as well as existing and new private investors. Today’s transaction has now completed the series A round, in which Maven has invested a total of GBP6.025m to date, alongside a further GBP1.375 million from private investors and regional funding.  Despite the pandemic, Oak Engage has continued to grow strongly, and today’s transaction will enable the business to scale further to support the lucrative customer contracts it has secured over the last 12 months, as well as create 26 new jobs across its sales and marketing divisions  Oak is a globally scalable cloud-based platform with flexible software that makes it suitable for businesses of all sizes, used by hundreds of thousands of people every day across a multitude of sectors. Oak Engage allows businesses to engage and connect their people through its mobile app and SaaS (Software as a Service) platform. The cloud-based, next-generation software provides a range of internal communications tools that integrate seamlessly with office applications, helping improve productivity with feeds, collaboration hubs and advanced search.  The product has a very broad set of additional proprietary functionality, including rota management, instant messenger, surveys, opinion polls, employee recognition, trending content and push notifications. Oak works with some of the world’s biggest brands including Aldi, Five Guys, Halfords and ITV to name a few, and have become intranet software experts and thought leaders within the employee engagement industry.  Maven originally invested back in 2018 via the Maven Investor Partners network and the Finance Durham Fund to strengthen the company’s sales and marketing, expand the roll-out of its software, and develop its team. Since the initial investment, the business has experienced strong growth, and now supports a number of enterprise-sized corporates with an impressive customer base of FTSE 100 and multinational clients who join the list of house-hold brands the company already works with, such as Aldi, Five guys, ITV, BooHoo and NEP Inc, Group.  Led by a seasoned former Silicon Valley executive, Will Murray, who has a successful track record of scaling technology businesses and was a key member of the management team of Turnitin, a US software company which recently sold to a private equity buyer for USD1.75 billion.  Michael Vassallo, Investment Director at Maven, says: “Oak is a proven, fast growing technology business led by strong, experienced management team. The platform is globally scalable and as employee engagement is becoming increasingly recognised as pivotal in the overall success of a business, Oak continues to secure a number of impressive customer contacts. We look forward to working with Will and the team as the company scales further and continues to expand.”  Will Murray, CEO of Oak, says: “With the work we have done so far we are just beginning to see how transformational our new approach to the company intranet can be. This further injection of capital further secures our place as industry leaders within the intranet software and internal comms industry. We will continue to invest in growth, our technology and in our product as we continue to push forward with the support of investors.  “Products like our intranet software can help businesses connect their people, boost employee engagement, and promote wellbeing, giving everyone a voice at a time when they need it most. This will be key now that the majority of people will want some sort of flexible working situation going forwards. There is so much more to come from Oak Engage in the coming months and years.” ",uncredited,22341-30270,Wires,Web,,Private Equity Wire,Private Equity Wire,https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk,2021-07-07 08:18:13,https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/2021/07/07/303036/maven-completes-gbp74m-series-investment-oak-engage,Europe,Western Europe,United Kingdom,,en,38089,,27,7,Positive,0,,,1,,,,1,"The article is not about the company, but it is mentioned because its partnering",1,40,1,5.5,51.8344730907464

The mural, which features the Swedish teenager up to her eyes in rising sea levels, has been on the side of the Tobacco Factory in Ashton Gate since May 2019   Greta even used it as her profile picture on her social media accounts for some time, although she didn't get the chance to see it in person when she visited Bristol to lead a school strike for climate in February 2020.   READ MORE: Upfest 2021 postponed again due to pandemic   As part of the Upfest street art festival, which is based in North Street, the landmark walls like the side of the Tobacco Factory are regularly repainted every one or two years. Previous works have included a colourful portrait of John Lennon and, most recently in 2018, an image of Lisa Simpson with a megaphone when Upfest had a Simpsons theme.   The Greta mural lasted more than two years because of the coronavirus pandemic, which postponed last year's Upfest.   This year's festival, initially delayed until August, has now been cancelled as well, but a huge project to paint 77 walls in 77 days is almost completed - so instead of all the street art changing in Ashton, Southville and Bedminster in just one weekend, it's taking place over the course of more than three months.   The Greta artwork was the biggest piece done to date by Bristolian street artist Jody Thomas , who said he wanted to highlight the impending nightmare of climate change. He said he was pleased when Greta used the image as her Insta profile pic.

Send your videos to video@trinitymirror.com   This morning, the wall was fenced off and a cherry picker was in place to assist in the job of painting over the Greta Thunberg mural in preparation for something new to be painted there.   There is no confirmation of what will replace that now iconic image of Greta Thunberg, but it's likely to be stunning.   Greek artist Insane 51 is the street artist with the job of following Jody's Greta, and he is already well known to Upfest and Bristol's street art fans.   He's the genius behind an innovative work of art that adorned the side of the Ashton Plate cafe, just round the corner from Greta in the Aldi car park, on the corner of Baynton Road and Ashton Road.   The work on the side of the Ashton Plate Cafe in Ashton Road, Ashton Gate, by Greek street artist Insane 51   (Image: John Myers)   His work featured a two-tone red and green image of a woman which, when viewed through the different lenses of 3D glasses showed either her skeleton or her head and hands.   Bristol Live understands the artist has been in quarantine in Bristol since arriving from Greece early last week, and is now ready to tackle the huge wall that faces the Aldi store on North Street in the coming days.

Two of them are even Demeter certified and got 5 ha out and were sold out after four weeks. So we decided to grow 15 ha this year,"" says Georg Thalhammer, managing director of the Steinfeld-based farm of the same name.  ""We have been on the market since the end of April, at the beginning still with spring garlic, there the garlic is offered bundled with green. And since mid-June we make fresh garlic, as it is known, with 10cm of stem. We supply the natural food trade and retaliers.""  On the quality of fresh garlic  Basically, he believes that regional goods or goods from Germany, as opposed to garlic from overseas, which is imported in containers, is both different in quality and preferred by the customer. ""Of course, we also want to improve. After all, the quality is also related to storage. After all, fresh garlic has a relatively short harvest period of about three to four weeks, depending on the region and variety. In the future, however, we want to be able to market fresh garlic until the new year. Which is why we're also investing in refrigeration capacity so it can also be stored in a controlled atmosphere.""  ""This year the quality is very nice in terms of growth. We just have to see how the wet weather affects the storability. Otherwise, I think an organic product always outperforms conventional products in terms of quality because the consumer is simply getting an honest, clean product. Basically, fresh garlic is just a great alternative for dried garlic because it's just milder and encourages cooking or eating it raw.""  Quantities and prices  ""We will harvest a total of about 100 tons this year. We are just starting the main harvest. In terms of price, we are around 8-9 euros for a kilo, although of course that also depends on whether the customer wants Demeter quality or normal organic quality,"" says Thalhammer. ""We currently supply the natural cost trade, but also Edeka and Tegut and will also start with Aldi in August.""  About Georg Thalhammer  ""I am a farmer from my history, but no longer operate a farm. I mainly take care of relieving my colleagues of the marketing, storage and preparation work. There are a total of 25 farms that grow pumpkins for me, which is our main product. The garlic is usually grown directly after the pumpkin, which is very advantageous because the field is then relatively clean. My garlic producers are all located in the Mainfranken region, i.e. the area around Würzburg. There are also good production conditions there. We want to expand cultivation to 50 hectares next year and also have created the corresponding storage capacity.""

Now she’s sold more than 50 charcuterie boards — and profited $2,000 in eight months. She juggles several boards a week, sometimes several a night, along with working as an accountant and office manager at a marine construction company.    “ I actually started my business during the pandemic. A lot of people wanted something different that could be delivered to their homes,” she said.    Starting a charcuterie board business is harder than just placing a few slices of gouda and cheddar next to some prosciutto then dropping in grapes. But if you have a knack for selecting specialty cured meats and artfully arranging them with all kinds of food, smart grocery shopping, lots of networking and love all the hustle of a side gig, charcuterie could be calling to you.    Yes, pandemic charcuterie board businesses popped up across the country as families stuck inside together or neighbors in a bubble grew tired of pizza, wings, and sourdough bread. Meat and cheese boards with all the fixin’s became a new staple.    “The holidays of 2020 is when it really took off. I probably did 20 boards in the month of December,” Anderson said. The demand didn’t slow much as she filled Super Bowl orders for meat and cheese boards and a custom board for a fancy date night at Valentine’s. Charcuterie boards were a fun and delicious way to watch March Madness and the perfect gift to send for a friend’s baby shower on Zoom.    An elaborate charcuterie board goes far beyond the cheese boards of days past, you see. They even go beyond just a meat and cheese board. Cured meats and cheese are still staples, but boards often include nuts, fruit, pickled vegetables, spreads, chutney, jams, crackers, bread and olives. Then there are people also making breakfast charcuterie boards with pancakes, fruit, chocolate and bacon, or dessert boards with dips, fruit, cookies, pretzels and candy corn (really).    There are countless books, Pinterest photos and Instagram posts full of ideas for themes, shapes and ingredients.   7 Steps to Starting a Charcuterie Business   Anderson has picked up some tricks and secrets of the charcuterie trade, like holiday cheeses sell out early at Aldi and Trader Joe’s has the perfect bite-size olive-and-fig crackers. Realtors like giving charcuterie boards as a housewarming gift after a closing.    But there are more nuts and bolts to consider.   1. Know What ‘Charcuterie’ Means   Before you dive into the business, know the definition of what you are making. The traditional word can be traced as far back as 15th century France. “Charcuterie” is a French word meaning “products produced by a fancy pork butcher.” Charcuterie generally refers to a display of prepared meats paired with cheeses and plain vegetables on a traditional board. They remain a popular way to feed guests on a budget for small parties or wine tastings.    2. Consider All the Startup Costs   Anderson’s biggest startup cost was a $60 round wooden charcuterie board that’s about three feet in diameter from T.J. Maxx. She uses it for her grazing tables, which serve about 30 people.    For other small, medium and large orders she assembles the charcuterie on disposable hard plastic trays that come with lids and cost about $4 on Amazon.    She’s also bought a few distinctive bowls, spreaders and tongs. But all together the startup investment was under $300.   3. Do the Math on Pricing Your Products   “The hardest part is figuring out prices and what people are willing to pay,” Anderson said. “I really had to sit down with my mom, who is in the catering business, and figure it out. My main goal was to keep it to around $9 to $10 a head. With that I’m making a really good profit.”    Her smallest charcuterie board sells for $40 and she can usually make it for a cost of around $20. But when you figure in the time for grocery shopping, assembly and delivery, that profit isn’t even $10 an hour. Yet when she makes three or more similar boards within a couple days and combines shopping and assembly time, her profit margin improves.    On most boards, Anderson automatically includes crackers, bread, nuts, olives, pickles, fruits and vegetables. Clients can pick the main ingredients from four categories: hard cheese, soft cheese, meat and spread. With the small boards, which serve two to four people, they get four options. They pick six options for the medium, which costs $70 and serves four to eight. Clients pick eight options for the large board, which serves eight to 12 and costs $100.   4. Learn to Create and Perfect Your Charcuterie Boards   Anderson, who’s 26, has been helping her mom on catering projects since she was 14 and was drawn to charcuterie several years ago.    “My mom says she watches me and I just move things around back and forth 10 times or more until I’m completely satisfied with how it looks,” she said. “It’s kind of like painting a painting to me.”     She learned recipes for five different spreads, including lemon whipped ricotta and a sun-dried tomato spread, from friends and family over the years. She also has several go-to charcuterie books including On Boards, That Cheese Plate Will Change Your LIfe and Beautiful Boards .   5. Cheese Here, Crackers There: Shop for a Charcuterie Board   “If I’m doing a bigger board or multiple boards I go to Sam’s (Club) hand’s down. The prices are great. I can get a big wheel of brie and distribute it between three boards,” Anderson said.    If it’s just one board she heads to Aldi.    “They have a really good variety of cheese. They have specialty cheese on holidays. For St. Patrick’s Day they had green gouda. For Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day they had cheese shaped like a heart,” she said. “I buy several of those as soon as they have them because they always sell out. Then I can premake a themed board to show on social media for people to get the idea to order.”   6. Attract Charcuterie Board Customers on Social Media   With 200 followers on Coastal Charcuterie’s Instagram page and about 200 for the Facebook page , Anderson has steady business, which goes to show you don’t have to go viral or be a serious social media influencer to have a successful side gig. She uses hashtags that local foodies follow and a variety of others including  #charcuterieofInstagram.    Anderson engages followers with photos of her boards, of course. She posts examples of themed boards for graduates and teachers at the end of school, moms at Mother’s Day and for the Super Bowl a week or so before clients would need to order them.    She created her own website and includes the link on all of her social media so customers can see more photos and place orders.     FROM THE MAKE MONEY FORUM       What's the best job or side gig you've ever had and why?   6/10/21 @ 8:27 PM          I feel stuck. How do I get my e-commerce biz going?   7/2/21 @ 2:57 PM          Is burnout inevitable when you work multiple jobs?   7/1/21 @ 12:48 PM         See more in Make Money or ask a money question     7. Balance Your Charcuterie Side Gig With A Full Time Job   “Sometimes I do two to three orders a day on the weekends. I do a lot of the prep work the night before, cutting up the cheese and meats,” Anderson said. “I make all the spreads the night before, too. Then the day of, I cut up any fruit and vegetables and assemble each board. I do them all at once.”    If she has an event after work, she rushes home and assembles all the pre-cut foods then delivers the boards.    Anderson keeps all size boards on hand for last-minute orders so she’s not running out to buy them as well as food. And if it’s really last minute, she will suggest whatever food she has on hand to the client so there’s no extra trip to the grocery store.

0,Aldi,8975451119,regionals-web,2021-07-07,2021-07-07 19:00:22,opoint,National readers react to Scottish Tesco playing England anthem,"   NATIONAL readers have told of their anger at Tesco after we reported on the supermarket ""rubbing salt in the wounds"" of Scottish football fans.   A member of the Tartan Army contacted The National after their evening shopping trip to a Glasgow Tesco revealed the store to be playing Vindaloo by Fat Les.   The song's lyrics include the line: ""We're England! We're gonna score one more than you.""   The disgruntled customer said the store had shown ""little or no regard for their customers in Scotland,"" calling the situation a ""complete joke"".   They told The National: “Scotland have had a wonderful achievement this summer, reaching a major final for the first time in 23 years. Not once over the last month when I was in a Tesco did I hear any Tartan Army songs being played – they had a chance to help boost national pride, but instead this is just salt in the wounds to any Scottish supporter.   “Of course we should want England to do well, but to blatantly ignore the fact that a huge part of your customer base will not be supporting the English team is nothing but blatant ignorance.”   Many of our readers commenting on social media and on our website were frustrated by the Union Jackery exhibited by Tesco.   Stephen Donnachie said: ""Boycott them. I barely buy anything out of there or Morrisons. I go to Aldi but even they are starting to get back with the union jacks. I don't think we can escape it.""   Paul Wilson said: ""Tesco, all the media, the majority of businesses and now Alistair Campbell playing Three Lions on the bagpipes and Lorraine Kelly cringing at him. Tesco, like the rest, don't just show little regard for customers in Scotland. What they always do is show little regard for those outside England.""   READ MORE:   National reader J Oliver added: ""It's simple, if you don't like what they do, don't give them your money. Frankly the refusal to remove deforestation practices from their supply chain is a bigger problem than playing a daft tune. This supermarket consistently puts profit ahead of people and planet. And please folks no England bashing, this is a shop decision, not representative of a country.""   Peter Cullen had a word of caution for the supermarkets: ""Dangerous game Tesco and Morrisons are playing. Perhaps that's why Lidl are building more stores in Scotland. Let's vote with our feet.""   Marie Jo McCrossan, meanwhile, had sympathy to spare: ""The thing is… football is the only saving grace that the English have at the moment. They're stuck with a cabinet in that couldn't be given away for free from Paddy's Market. It's only a game…""   READ MORE:   Ronnie Brown offered up an explanation: ""The in-store radio for most supermarkets and chain stores are based in the head offices, most of which are based in London.""   Tesco isn't the only supermarket to have ruffled feathers with the Tartan Army, however.   During the ongoing Euro 2020 tournament Alex-Lee MacDonald visited a Morrisons store.   ""Was in Morrisons straight after England-Germany game and they seemed to be playing Queen ⁠–⁠ We're The Champions on a loop. Not sure if it was coincidence,"" he said.   The blunders by Morrisons have been going on over a long period, as user John King noted: ""Morrisons was playing Three Lions on their tannoy a week before the referendum in 2014.""   User The Endless Death on Twitter shared a story of hope for those dismayed by Union Jackery: ""Worked with Tesco a long time ago, and remember the store got sent a load of St George's cross stuff to be put around the store for the World Cup in Japan ⁠–⁠ store manager took one look at it and told us to bin the lot.""   Some didn't find the story quite as problematic.   Alan Mitchell asked: ""Is that really important amidst all thats going on?""   Lee Gilray said: ""This is a silly story. Who cares really?""   Unionist columnist Alex Massie, retweeted by Baroness , wrote: ""The National continues to provide the answer to the question, ‘Why do you hate Scotland?'""   READ MORE:   LibDem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton – in the news recently after being – retweeted our story, adding: ""*from our guest Editor and Scottish Resistance co-founder: Sean Clerkin""   Scotland being knocked out stings even more now – we'd love to see how English shoppers would have reacted to Flower of Scotland blaring in supermarkets down south...

The German supermarket will be selling super-sized version of the appliance this week, launching on Wednesday July 7.   For $99, you can get your mitts on an 23-litre basket air fryer which even comes with an LED screen and seven cooking functions.   That's a fraction of the price of most air fryers on the market and even beats the Kmart seven litre air fryer that's currently $119.   All hail the Aldi Special Buys, right?   A healthier option. Source: Stock.   The Rise of The Air fyer   Air fryers have become the cult kitchen appliance of 2020. It's rise in popularity can be credited to endless TikTok cooking hacks using the fryer.   But also because unlike a conventional oven, the air fryer is actually a healthier option.   You only need to use one teaspoon of oil to make fries in an air fryer. And they actually taste just as good.   They're also great for time saving as they take far less time to cook.   For more information, check out the Aldi Special Buys online.

Comparing a trolley of 18 items, Lidl lost the top spot this month with Aldi becoming the cheapest grocer again.  Everyday throughout the month of June, Which? checked the prices of 18 items including own-brand products like apples and eggs as well as Hovis wholemeal bread.  On average, shoppers would have paid £21.61 at Aldi, which beat fellow discounter Lidl by just 20p.  Supermarket giant Asda claimed third spot while Tesco followed in fourth.  Customers shopping at Asda would have paid £21.99 for the trolley of 18 products while Tesco shoppers would’ve paid £24.21.  READ MORE: Nectar loyalty card offering new points boost for customers  “It could be worth switching supermarkets, or shopping around, if you want to trim your shopping bill.”  According to the consumer group, some of the biggest price differences included own-label free-range eggs.  Between Aldi and Waitrose there was a price difference of £1.06 while own-label chicken drumsticks had a difference of 85p.  The analysis also compared a bigger shopping trolley with 76 items to determine the cheapest supermarket.  The products included the original 18 plus 58 more like Branston baked beans and Colgate toothpaste.  Branded items aren’t always available at the discounter supermarkets and therefore this section of the analysis didn’t include Aldi or Lidl.  Asda took the top spot, costing £141.02 for the large trolley, followed by Sainsbury’s costing £144.88.  Morrisons and Tesco had just £1 separating them, with Morrisons’ trolley slightly winning at £150.87.  Which? has said it can’t compare exactly the same items each month because products aren’t always available but according to its data, Asda has been the cheapest ‘big four’ supermarket for more than a year.  It has claimed the title every month since January 2020.  Asda was £20.77 cheaper than the most expensive supermarket Waitrose, where customers would have paid £161.79.  In other news, lockdown restrictions are set to ease further on July 19.  This could see the wearing of face masks no longer a legal requirement.  Sainsbury’s said: “We are reviewing the latest guidance and will keep customers and colleagues updated on our plans.” ",uncredited,203073-591856,Consumer,Web,,The Amed Post,The Amed Post,https://amedpost.com,2021-07-07 23:43:45,https://www.amedpost.com/lidl-knocked-off-the-top-spot-as-cheapest-uk-supermarket-changes-again-beaten-by-20p/,Europe,Western Europe,United Kingdom,,en,18405,,11,5,Neutral,1,,1,,,,,,,2.5,12.9032258064516,0.5,4.55967741935484,34.1502547887793

New York-based Fortress has joined forces with Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board and the real-estate arm of Koch Industries, a private conglomerate headed by billionaire Charles Koch. The UK's fourth-largest grocery-chain operator had already last month rejected a £5.5bn takeover proposal, equivalent to $7.6bn, from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. The buyout firm has until July 17 to make a formal offer, and has said it was considering one. Morrisons shares rose 11% Monday to £2.67, above the level of the Fortress-led bid, which is worth £2.54 a share, including a two-pence special dividend. At the height of the pandemic last year, Morrisons and other grocery-store operators across Europe and the US were pushed to ramp up their online delivery services for homebound consumers and keep many of their stores open for those who needed to make in-store visits. But the costs of adding new safety protection measures and additional capacity to meet online sales growth in some cases undercut profits and weighed on the companies' stock prices. Based in northern England, Morrisons operates 497 supermarkets along with a network of cafes, gas stations and convenience-store outlets. The retailer also has a wholesale operation that includes supplying groceries to Amazon's Prime Now and other online delivery services. The retailer's e-commerce sales tripled in the financial year ended 31 January. But the costs to meet that demand by adding additional capacity among other Covid-19-related expenses, combined with a drop in fuel sales and the closure of the company's cafes during lockdown, offset much of that gain. Morrisons eked out a small year-over-year revenue gain of 0.4% to £17.6bn while operating profit sunk 51% to £254m over the same period. The retailer's prospects appear to be improving, underscoring the takeover interest in the company. It said its latest quarter ended 9 May showed signs of significantly lower Covid-19-related costs and a rebound in profit from fuel and food-to-go sales. Still, the Fortress group's bet on Morrisons is risky. The UK is considered one of the world's most competitive grocery-store markets, where Morrisons competes with three larger operators and two established German discounters, Aldi and Lidl. That competition pushed US retail giant Walmart in February to sell a majority stake in Asda Group, Britain's third-largest grocery company behind industry leader Tesco and J. Sainsbury, to TDR Capital, a Europe-focused buyout firm, and UK-based entrepreneur brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa. The bidders beat out Apollo for that business.

Mrs Hinch fans share 14p hack for descaling kettles," Cleaning star Mrs Hinch, whose real name is Sophie Hinchliffe, shot to fame after she shared her cleaning tips and recommendations on social media and TV. The cleaning enthusiast has now managed to gain over 4.1 million followers on Instagram. Now, fans of hers have created their own social media groups dedicated to cleaning and tidying tips.   On one of the groups, which has over 709,000 members, a woman asked how she can successfully descale her kettle.   She asked: “Please help, I need a natural descaler for my kettle, we live in a hard water area and I am fed up of all the scale and paying out for a new kettle every six months.”   The most common suggestion was to use “lemon juice” or a lemon.   You can buy a four-pack of lemons from ASDA for just 54p, working out at just under 14p per lemon.   READ MORE: Aldi announces Specialbuys landing in store this month   Another said: “Lemons. Once I've used the juice I chuck the rest in the kettle, boil it a couple of times.   “Leave it over night. Make sure you don't forget to rinse it out in the morning before making a cuppa!”   Another person suggested using lemon juice or vinegar.   “Lemon juice or vinegar overnight, then rinse, job done,” they said.   Another cleaning fan said: “Get the concentrated lemon juice in a bottle and splash a good few table spoons into some water (about a mug full of water) and boil a couple of times – will be like a new kettle!”   One individual said: “Cut a lemon in half and drop it in, just leave it for about half an hour, do it once a week. I learned this when I bought a glass kettle.”   Another social media user suggested: “Lemon juice! I use it to the descale kettle.   “Just squeeze into the kettle and leave for around half an hour then boil and empty.”   Another person explained: “I have a clear glass kettle so I have to clean mine weekly with a lemon.   “Cut it in half, squeeze lemon in the kettle then add the lemon halves.   “Shake around for a bit, leave it for about half hour add a little water, then boil.   “Shake it around again then use the lemon and rub all over [the kettle] then rinse and it's done.”   Other suggestions included using white vinegar, denture tablets, a water filter or a pebble.   “I live in a hard water area and just use white vinegar as soon as the lime scale starts to build up,” said one person.   Another user said: “Now don't laugh but my mum-in-law of 87 swears by the pebble in a kettle trick.

Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said the Government must provide clear guidance to the sector over plans to end the legal requirement to wear masks in stores to avoid confrontations.   The boss added that retailers are expected to keep hand sanitiser and screens in stores to protect staff.   She said: “Our primary concern is that Government messaging is clear about what is regulation and what is advisory so that people understand what's expected of them, and that people are tolerant and allow others to make their own personal choices.   “There has been a big rise in violence and abuse against retail workers during the pandemic and colleagues cannot be put in the firing line because of this change in policy.”   The chief added: “Retailers will have many people in their stores who want to continue wearing masks, and many who don't, and will have to accommodate everyone.”   Her comments come as several retailers weigh up whether to continue asking customers to wear masks in stores beyond the July 19 date when the Government is expected to relax the vast majority of Covid-19 restrictions.   Sainsbury's boss Simon Roberts said earlier this week that he would consult with staff but suggested the decision on masks would be one of “personal choice”.   The PA news agency understands that supermarket chains Morrisons and Aldi are among retailers requesting more detailed guidance soon.   Meanwhile, Tesco is understood to be currently undertaking an internal review into its mask-wearing policy following the Government update on Monday evening.   On Monday, Boris Johnson said the Government is planning to halt the legal requirement regarding face coverings.   He did however add that he would wear a face covering in crowded places and as a matter of courtesy.   Other ministers have subsequently said they would be “carrying” masks and would wear them in certain circumstances.   England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty also said on Monday he would continue wearing a mask “in any situation that was indoors and was crowded, or indoors and in close proximity to other people”.   The BRC's warning comes as retailers and other businesses are concerned that plans to keep self-isolation rules in place until August would also have an impact on workers who would be forced to stay home.   Hospitality chiefs have warned that the delay between restrictions being lifted and the self-isolation rules being eased risks “the summer being cancelled and vast swathes of the population unnecessarily confined to their homes”.   Kate Nicholls, boss of trade body UKHospitality, said: “This is not just a hospitality issue – it is affecting the whole economy and we need an earlier test to release system in place.”   Ms Dickinson, of the BRC, added: “We are already seeing a serious impact on retail operations as a result of staff having to self-isolate and this will only get worse right across the economy, as cases are already rising fast and the final restrictions are eased.” ",uncredited,22061-641323,Regional News,Web,,Clacton Gazette,Clacton Gazette,http://www.clactonandfrintongazette.co.uk,2021-07-08 07:57:04,https://www.clactonandfrintongazette.co.uk/news/national/19428174.mask-rule-change-risks-rise-abuse-towards-shop-workers-trade-body-warns/,Europe,Western Europe,United Kingdom,,en,184249,,17,6,Positive,0,,,1,,,,1,"This is a issue from the goverment, no Aldi.

Whether it's the size of the roads or our taste in cuisine, it's safe to say that as well as doing it dreckly here in Cornwall, we also do it differently.  Here there is no Harrods, only Trago Mills. There are more sheep on the roads than there are motorways.  We've got more beaches than a fair bit of England combined and no major sports stadium either.  I tried to do a weekly shop at Aldi with just £10 and learned a valuable lesson  But when it comes to the ways to tell you grew up in Cornwall, there's quite a list to choose from.  While we might not all be jolly farmers and happy fishermen like you see on those TV programs, the one thing that Cornwall is is Cornish - and here are 21 ways of telling you grew up in Cornwall.  When motorways are like driving on a foreign road  Motorways? What do you mean, THREE lanes? Motorways don’t exist in Cornwall, much like predictable weather patterns or ATMs that give away free money. This is a thrill we have to go all the way to Exeter to enjoy.  Surely it’s not just me who copes with the horrors of the M5 by approaching it as “a dual carriageway with a maniac lane”, no?  We have our own Disneyland - Trago  Trago Mills, Liskeard  Florida and Paris eat your heart out. Cornwall has its own Disneyland. Only it’s nothing like Disney and it's like the Cornish marmite. You either love it or hate it. Its fans will tell you it’s a unique experience and those who don’t will tell you it’s more ‘Dismalland’ than ‘Disneyland’.  But where London might have Harrods and Devon had Debenhams, Cornwall has Trago Mills. Not just one, like Devon and Wales but TWO Tragos both with their own unique shopping experiences. That’s before we mention the statues of the politicians the owner hated and the occasional peacock found roaming.  Although, there are always those bargains you can’t find elsewhere while you spend a day exploring and getting lost within its vast confines.  Visits outside Cornwall can sometimes end up trying to see if there are any actual Cornish pasty shops there. Sometimes there are, such as at Paddington Station and it’s welcome heaven if you’ve been deprived for a while, but it’s not quite a Barnecutts….

Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said the Government must provide clear guidance to the sector over plans to end the legal requirement to wear masks in stores to avoid confrontations.   The boss added that retailers are expected to keep hand sanitiser and screens in stores to protect staff.   She said: “Our primary concern is that Government messaging is clear about what is regulation and what is advisory so that people understand what's expected of them, and that people are tolerant and allow others to make their own personal choices.   “There has been a big rise in violence and abuse against retail workers during the pandemic and colleagues cannot be put in the firing line because of this change in policy.”   The chief added: “Retailers will have many people in their stores who want to continue wearing masks, and many who don't, and will have to accommodate everyone.”   Her comments come as several retailers weigh up whether to continue asking customers to wear masks in stores beyond the July 19 date when the Government is expected to relax the vast majority of Covid-19 restrictions.   Sainsbury's boss Simon Roberts said earlier this week that he would consult with staff but suggested the decision on masks would be one of “personal choice”.   The PA news agency understands that supermarket chains Morrisons and Aldi are among retailers requesting more detailed guidance soon.   Meanwhile, Tesco is understood to be currently undertaking an internal review into its mask-wearing policy following the Government update on Monday evening.

Mum-of-two Nikki Matthews, 29, from Bristol, ordered a grey four seater sofa from DFS in May, which would arrive in 12 weeks.                    The sofa costs £1,165, which she opted to pay in interest-free monthly instalments over four years.                    But as she was waiting for it to be delivered, she noticed that DFS had slashed the price to £999 in the sale.                    Nikki’s friend, who was also waiting for a sofa from DFS, tipped her off that the shop would match the new price of the sofa if it hadn’t arrived yet.                   Calling her local DFS branch with her order number handy, Nikki asked whether she would be able to get the discount on the sofa.                   She was told the £165 discount would be knocked off her final payment.                   Nikki told The Sun: “I had an email the next day saying they had adjusted the cost by £165.                   “It’s a really good saving, especially as I have a young family, and the money will most definitely be put to use elsewhere.                    “I did go and buy my friend some of her favourite fancy dark chocolate as a thank you though.”                   However, there’s no guarantee you’ll get the same discount as DFS told The Sun that it has no company policy in place where it price matches items in the sale.                   It added that there may have been other factors involved as to why money was knocked off Nikki’s sofa.                   It is also worth noting that some retailers allow stores and managers to offer discounts at their own discretion.                   The savvy saver shared her bargain in the Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK Facebook group, and hundreds of shoppers liked and commented on her post.                                        How to compare prices to get the best deal                                      JUST because something is on offer, or is part of a sale, it doesn't mean it's always a good deal.                   There are plenty of comparison websites out there that’ll check prices for you – so don’t be left paying more than you have to.                   Most of them work by comparing the prices across hundreds of retailers.                   Here are some that we recommend:                                                                                        Google Shopping is a tool that lets users search for and compare prices for products across the web. Simply type in keywords, or a product number, to bring up search results.                                                                                          Price Spy logs the history of how much something costs from over 3,000 different retailers, including Argos, Amazon, eBay and the supermarkets. Once you select an individual product you can quickly compare which stores have the best price and which have it in stock.                                                                                          Idealo is another website that lets you compare prices between retailers. All shoppers need to do is search for the item they need and the website will rank them from the cheapest to the most expensive one.                                                                                          CamelCamelCamel only works on goods being sold on Amazon. To use it, type in the URL of the product you want to check the price of.                                                           A number of shoppers said they had tried the hack with DFS following Nikki’s post, and had also been given money off their sofa.                   One happy customer said: “We did it as well. Very easy. Just phoned them and they sorted straight away.”                   Another said: “[I] got £200 refunded.”                   Nikki said: “I only posted it as I figured if i didn’t have a clue about it, I would imagine loads of others didn’t as well.                   “Plus, I was pretty chuffed with the saving and wanted to share it.”                   Jordon Cox, dubbed Britain’s Coupon Kid for his savvy saving ways, said shoppers shouldn’t be shy in trying to get money knocked off their bill.                   “Haggling on the high street should be more common than it is – especially when buying high ticket items like white goods and furniture,” he said.                   Retailers like John Lewis, Currys PC World and Wickes have policies in place which allow customers to ask for price matches with other retailers on goods.                   Jordon said shoppers should make the most of this benefit.                   “You can use this to your advantage by having the retailers haggle over the items themselves trying to give you the best price.                    “That’s why it’s always worth shopping around and seeing where you want to buy it from.”                   But before you splash out on any sofa, make sure to compare prices online.                   You might find the same – or similar – couch going for less elsewhere.                   DFS isn’t the only store where you can get furniture bargains.                   Next has launched it’s infamous seasonal sale, and there’s up to 70% off items including homeware.                   Aldi also slashed 40% off items from chairs to bedside tables in a Specialbuys offer.                   Meanwhile B&M is selling homeware dupes that cost up to 67% less than Wayfair or Dunelm.                   Plus, Ikea launched a massive summer sale with up to 50% off furniture last month.                   That’s as well as launching its own “buy now, pay later” scheme letting shoppers spread the cost of buying new furniture without paying interest.

Shoppers nationally had noticed German discount supermarket shelves emptier than usual, taking pictures of the clear gaps on the shelves.   And supermarkets including Morrisons, Tesco and Aldi, are also rumoured to be having issues.   There has been a variety of explanations for the shortage on the shelves, including Brexit and coronavirus, but it is understand a lack of lorry drivers is the main cause of the issues.   In a statement issued due to the problems nationally Aldi said: ""Unfortunately, like a number of other retailers, the availability of some products has been impacted by the current disruptions to supply chain networks.   ""We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and are doing all we can to resolve the issues as soon as possible and to minimise any impact to our customers.""   In March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, there was an appeal to shoppers in Worcester to not bulk or ‘panic' buy as empty shelves appeared in supermarkets then. The most popular items that were difficult to get hold of at the time included toilet roll, bread, handwash and soap.   Last month we reported on industry experts warning empty shelves was 'inevitable' due to staff shortages across low-paying sectors including harvesting, manufacturing, and in particular a chronic lack of drivers.   ""The real crisis for food supplies starts now,” said Shane Brennan, chief executive officer of the Cold Chain Federation when speaking to the Guardian.   He said that while he was typically wary of empty shelf warnings, “this time definitely feels different”.   Trade website The Grocer also reported that trade bodies, logistics firms and suppliers had all been warning that the end of lockdown, combined with the summer holidays could see a tipping point reached.

Chief Badgley has been a member of the Peshtigo Police Department for over 40 years, the last three as Chief.  Sievert's wife, Alderman Debbie Sievert, abstained from voting on his selection as interim chief, and Alderman Brigitte Schmidt was absent. Voting in favor was Aldermen John Berendt, Rick Berth, Katie Berman, and Keith Klimek.  Council also approved a recommendation from the Streets and Drainage Committee to have the dumpster at the city garage open from 8 a.m. to noon on Saturday, July 17. Alderman John Berendt, who chairs the committee, noted the Saturday hours are provided as a convenience for residents who have items to dispose of that cannot be put in containers for regular garbage collection. Regular charges for disposal will apply, but for this day only, the fees can be paid right at the disposal site instead of having to be paid in advance at the Municipal Building.  In other business, Crystal Gardon and Nicole Schingick briefly explained plans for a new and improved playground at Badger Park, aimed at preserving and improving the nostalgia that goes with Badger Boardwalk, and Council approved a Parks and Recreation Committee recommendation to have Parks and Recreation Director Lori Tonn work with them, along with Laura Finger, Morgan Oestreich, and Jenni Hofer to fundraise on behalf of the city for Badger Boardwalk updates, with changes to be approved by the Parks and Recreation Committee.  Gardon explained they had met with four different companies on playground design before deciding to work with the firm that had designed the new Peshtigo Elementary playground. ""We all grew up with Badger Park,"" Gardon declared, and added they want to preserve and rejuvenate the nostalgic memories they have of Badger Boardwalk. However, she said, Badger Boardwalk is 26 years old, which is about the average lifespan of playground equipment, and now they want to create a playground that will provide similar nostalgia for their children.  ""I think these girls have put together something phenomenal,"" Tonn declared. She said the young women had put a lot of thought into their selection of design. Tonn agreed there is much concern in the community over Badger Boardwalk and memories associated with it. Alderman Sievert also thanked the young women for their awesome presentation at the Parks and Recreation Committee meeting on June 24.  Council also approved an RLF/UDAG Committee recommendation to give a loan of $46,000 to Driven Agriculture, LLC with interest at 125 basis points above the 10-year treasury yield for 15 years, contingent upon a second position on the real estate, personal guarantees, and other loan requirements and procedures.  Street use permits were approved for The River Pub for a motorcycle and car show on Saturday, Aug. 21, and Peshtigo Historical Society for an ice cream social and cemetery walk on Sunday, Sept. 26.  Several Streets and Drainage Committee recommendations were approved, including a request from Brian Eggener to install a second driveway on his property at 940 French Street, extending the recycling contract with Harter's Fox Valley Disposal for two years, and accepting high bids of $2,300 from Tom Rogendorf for purchase of the 1998 Loadmaster rear load garbage truck, $2,800 from Tom McClellan for the 1989 Sewer jetter on an International truck chassis and $3,900 from Tom McClellan for the 1994 Mowbark chipper.  Council also approved recommendations of the Water and Sewer committee to accept the bid from Barley Trucking and Excavating in the amount of $173,404.89 for the 2021 E. Front Street Water Main contract; proposal of FSO for hauling and land application of wastewater treatment plant biosolids generated after August of 2019, and hiring of GEI Consultants, Inc. ""as proposed,"" to undertake the remedial action plan for the handling of PFAS-impacted biosolids being stored at the wastewater treatment plant.  Chief Badgley's pending retirement and naming of his successor were announced by Malke at the start of Tuesday's Council meeting.  ""I am writing to express my sincere gratitude to you, the citizens of Peshtigo, a host of partners and partner agencies too numerous to name, and the employees who have traversed the ranks of the Peshtigo Police Department over the last 40 years,"" Chief Badgley wrote in the resignation letter addressed to Malke. ""I have been so fortunate to have had an opportunity to serve the city where I have resided for 30 years. I have had a variety of roles, beginning in March 1982 as Patrol Officer, then promoted to sergeant and culminating with my service as Chief of Police from 2018 until today.""  ""When I reflect on the last 40 years, many moments come to mind. I picture events that will forever be emblematic of the tragedy, importance, and occasional humor of our work policing Peshtigo. Among the most rewarding experiences were the opportunities to train police officers, initiatives, and strategies to move the Department and City forward; provide some measure of comfort to victims, survivors, and family members affected by the tragedy, crime, and violence; and engage so many members of our vibrant community in our efforts to make Peshtigo the safest, healthiest, and most livable small city in the area,"" Badgley's letter went on.  ""No contemporary police department can provide the safety, security, and problem-solving capacity that communities need without robust partnerships,"" Badgley wrote. ""We have been fortunate to have support from so many partners and partner agencies. From community members to local businesses, healthcare providers to social service, educational institutions, there are so many who help us accomplish our work every day. To each of our partners and to so many people who have engaged in community initiatives, I extend a heartfelt thank you.  ""When I was hired, Chief Thomas Strouf told me that I had entered the noblest of professions. Some time a few years prior to then, President Theodore Roosevelt said in an address to the New York City Police Department,""Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.""I hope that my efforts have, in some small way, embodies the essence of these statements and the best traditions of the history of the Peshtigo Police Department,"" Badgley's letter continued.  ""Most importantly, those who do the increasingly challenging work of policing that is so essential and so often misunderstood and underappreciated - and the family and friends who support them each day - will always have my unwavering support, gratitude, and admiration. I am honored to have been fortunate enough to serve with them.  ""As I prepare for the next phase of my life, I am confident that my colleagues at the Peshtigo Police Department are well-positioned to continue the Department's important work for the community,"" Badgley's letter concluded.  Malke said she first met then-Officer Badgley when she was on a Rescue Squad call. After that, she said whenever the pager would go off and it was for a ""Pulseless Non-Breather,"" she would hope Rick was working. ""Officer Badgley would always respond to the residence to show responding units where the call was located and would start CPR until a responding rescue unit could relieve him. He's saved more lives than any Rescue Squad member,"" Malke declared.  She also related an incident that happened when she and her family were camping at Badger Park. Fights had broken out at three different campsites, and items were flying everywhere, Malke recalled. ""I called dispatch to notify them about what was taking place, and within five minutes Officer Badgley pulled in and started walking toward all the commotion.  ""For his safety, I informed him dispatch was sending extra help from Marinette Police Department, but Officer Badgley continued to walk toward all the fighting."" He started talking to the disorderly campers in a controlled voice, Malke said, and within five minutes they had all quit fighting and started packing their belongings, Malke said.  Malke noted Officer Badgley was later promoted to Sergeant Badgley and three years ago she appointed him to the position of Chief Badgley.  Malke said in 2019 she was proud to nominate Chief Badgley to be honored as the First Responder of the Year for the 89th Assembly District, ""...because I had seen firsthand all the lives he saved and care he gave to persons in need.""  On Wednesday, June 30, Chief Badgley turned in his retirement paperwork after protecting the City of Peshtigo for over 40 years. Malke thanked Badgley for all his years of service and declared he will be missed.  Malke said on Thursday, July 1, after receiving Chief Badgley's paperwork the previous day, she contacted Lieutenant Jared Phillips and offered him the position of interim Police Chief until a new Police Chief could be hired. ""Lieutenant Phillips thanked me for the gesture of a promotion to Chief, but declined, saying he likes his current position,"" Malke said.  Next, she called Detective Mike Sievert, who has been working part-time as an investigator with the city's Police Department. He is retired from the Marinette County Sheriff's Department after more than 20 years of service. ""Mike's qualifications are many,"" Malke said. ""He started as a Patrol Deputy, was promoted to Patrol Sergeant and then to Detective Sergeant. His certifications are many, including Fire Investigator (Certified by the National Fire Academy), Death Investigator (Certified by DCI), Evidence Technician, K-9 handler with extensive drug interdictions and arrests. He is also a member of the Sheriff's Department dive team.  Malke said because she was trying to remain within the budget she offered Mike Sievert the position of Interim Chief of Police, with a working cap of 29 hours.  Pay for Sievert while serving as interim chief is still be determined by the Personnel Committee. Alderman Sievert, who chairs that committee, noted she will abstain from acting on issues pertaining to her husband's employment. She, Berendt, and others on the Council joined Malke in thanking Badgley for his many years of service to the city and wished him well in his retirement.  Badgley was born in Rhinelander in 1952 and earned an Associates Degree in Police Science from Nicolet College in 1973 after attending classes there for two years. He worked at Rhinelander Paper Mill from 1973 to 1975, and then was employed as a Three Lakes Police Officer from 1975 until 1982 when he joined the Peshtigo Police Department, where he has served ever since.  He and his wife, Carol (Scholtes) Badgley, are members of St. Mary Catholic Church and have four adult children, Jennifer, Jamie, Richard, and Rachel.

The key function of a transmission system is to circulate power from the engine. These systems utilize gears and clutch to provide torque conversions and speed.  The growing demand to improve vehicle performance and fuel economy, the changing and varied needs of users, and the demand for enhanced driving experience have resulted in the development of advanced automotive transmission systems.  Automotive Transmission Systems Market: Comprehensive Insights  Hoping to minimize the transmission power response time and comply with carbon emission norms, automobile manufacturers are constantly conducting R&D activities to improve vehicle performance. This has resulted in the development of advanced transmission systems.  Dual clutch transmission (DCT) and continuously variable transmission (CVT) are two main types of automotive transmission systems. Customers across the globe have different needs and preferences for transmission systems, which has led to diverse market conditions for both CVT and DCT. For instance, CVTs have gained preference over DCTs in North America and Asia, while CVTs are likely to be discontinued in Europe, with DCT installation rates gaining greater ground.  Leading automakers such as Volkswagen and Honda manufacture their own automotive transmission systems in-house by partnering with other Tier-I technology vendors. This has resulted in limited scope for growth of other automotive transmission system manufacturers.  Automotive Transmission Systems Market: Major Segments  The global automotive transmission systems market has been segmented based on type into continuously variable transmission (CVT) and dual clutch transmission (DCT). On the basis of type of vehicle, the market takes into consideration commercial vehicles and passenger cars. From the point of view of geography, the worldwide market for automotive transmission systems can be categorized into Europe, North America, Asia Pacific, and the Rest of the World.  Get Brochure of the Report @ https://www.tmrresearch.com/sample/sample?flag=B&rep_id=13  Automotive Transmission Systems Market: Drivers and Restraints  The report highlights the prominent factors influencing the growth of the automotive transmission systems market. Based on the findings of the report, the need to reduce carbon emissions, the growing demand for the expansion of production facilities, the need for better fuel efficiency than that offered by conventional transmission systems, and high installation rates of continuously variable transmission systems in Asia Pacific and North America are currently driving the demand for automotive transmission systems.  On the flip side, high maintenance cost and performance gaps pose a major challenge for the growth of the automotive transmission systems market. Moreover, high cost constraints of dual clutch transmission systems and technical limitations of continuously variable transmission systems result in a lower installation rate in commercial vehicles across the globe.  On the plus side, however, the increased demand for hybrid vehicles presents key opportunities for this market. Automobile manufacturers in developing markets such as Brazil and India are yet to explore the use of these technologies, which is likely to spur the demand for automotive transmission systems at greater levels.  Automotive Transmission Systems Market: Vendor Landscape  There are several leading players operating in the automotive transmission systems market. These include Borgwarner Inc., Fiat Powertrain, Aisin Aw Co. Ltd., Gkn Driveline, Hofer Powertrain GmbH, Hilite International, Fuji Heavy Industries, Jatco Ltd., Magna Powertrain, Niba Ag, IAV Automotive Engineering, Ntc Powertrain, Luk GmbH& Co., Suzler Ltd., Valeo, Tremec, and Ricardo plc.

J Sainbury SBRY 282.30p CONSUMER STAPLES   Private equity is hungry for new deals and UK grocers currently look like some of the tastiest on the menu.   With Asda snapped up and a coterie of suitors now circling Wm Morrison (MRW), attention is naturally turning to larger rival Sainsbury's (SBRY), which has similarly been suffering years of underperformance. A share price festering near multi-decade lows combined with its vast footprint and historic brand must be tempting many buyout firms.   But following a trading update on 6 July, chief executive Simon Roberts was quick to shoot down speculation. ""If we had anything to update on, we'd be updating on it,"" he said.   Instead, the company wanted to direct attention towards its internal restructuring effort, laid out by the newly instated Roberts in November. It said the plan to put food back at the heart of Sainsbury's had since helped it pick up market share: sales excluding fuel grew 1.6 per cent year on year in the quarter ending in June, exceeding expectations. The supermarket lifted its guidance for full-year underlying profit before tax from £620m to £660m.   Now Sainsbury's is funnelling some of its surplus cash into a £50m price war with Aldi, the German budget supermarket that helped send its shares tumbling when it first stormed onto the UK market about a decade ago. The British grocer's aggressive strategy explicitly aims to match Aldi on price, while delivering ""Sainsbury's quality"". If it can find a buyer for its struggling bank, it could be a winning recipe.   Sainsbury's shares have picked up since November and current investors should be keen to see if the new leadership can continue to deliver on the restructuring effort, rather than cash out at a deflated price in a private equity buyout.   Others may be inspired to reconsider the business, which has long been dismissed as one of the rotten vegetables in the UK stock basket. Analysis by Investors' Chronicle shows short-sellers have taken more positions against Sainsbury's than any other UK stock over the past decade, although the takeover speculation has prompted some to pull back. Low margins and vulnerability to competitors mean supermarkets will never lead the UK market. But at such a low valuation we think Sainsbury's deserves a hopeful upgrade to hold.

This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.  Millions of Sydneysiders are in limbo, with authorities warning even another week of lockdown may not be enough to halt their burgeoning COVID outbreak.  Local coronavirus cases spiked to a new high on Friday, with 44 new infections confirmed.  It meant that – on the day the lockdown of greater Sydney and its surrounds was originally meant to lift – Premier Gladys Berejiklian instead tightened rules across the city and warned of higher case numbers ahead.  The lockdown, already extended until July 16, is also likely be further extended.  “[This is] the greatest threat we have faced in NSW since the pandemic started … [and] at the moment the numbers are not heading in the right direction,” she said on Friday.  “The rate of infection therefore is going up exponentially every day.  “Unless there’s a dramatic turnaround in the numbers, I can’t see how we’ll be in a position to ease restrictions by next Friday.”  Ms Berejiklian said a premature reopening of greater Sydney would quickly lead to thousands of coronavirus cases, hospitalisations and deaths.  “We do not have the option of living with this. We have to quash the community transmission,” she said.  “It is up to all of us to turn things around. Because at the moment the numbers are not heading in the right direction. But we do have the ability to do that.”  The number of close contacts isolating across NSW also doubled in 24 hours to Friday morning, with 14,000 people told to stay home after exposure as numerous large venues.  The latest include Ikea in Tempe, where an infected worker potentially exposed hordes of customers during an 11-hour shift. Other recent exposure sites across Sydney include an Aldi in Merrylands and more shops in Auburn, Parramatta and Burwood.  There will also be tighter virus restrictions in greater Sydney, the Central Coast, Blue Mountains and Wollongong. Ms Berejiklian urged people to stop using exemptions as loopholes to leave the house.  “We’re still getting questions … about how many people you can have into your home. The answer is zero,” Ms Berejiklian said.  “Do not go [out] to an indoor setting because you’re bored and it’s a rainy weekend. That is how the virus spreads.  “The message I’m delivering today is quite shocking for a lot of people but I need everybody to be shocked.”  From 5pm Friday, residents will be banned from exercising more than 10 kilometres from their home, and only in groups of two people or with their immediate household.  Funerals in affected areas will be capped at 10 people.  Browsing at shops is prohibited, and only one person per household may leave the home for shopping each day.  “We are now not only looking at areas where the transmission has occurred but trying to prevent any super-seeding events,” Ms Berejiklian said.  Of Friday’s cases, 27 were active in the community for at least part of the time they were infectious.  Ten COVID-19 patients in NSW are in intensive care, with four ventilated. Among them is one person aged in their 20s and another in their 30s.  Also on Friday, NSW Police stepped up patrols on the streets of south-west Sydney to ensure compliance with COVID-19 health orders.  Senior police insist the move isn’t about discrimination or racism, despite the concentration of multicultural communities in the target suburbs.  NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Mark Morrow said the south-western push mirrored similar efforts in Bondi when the latest outbreaks emerged, and on the northern beaches late in 2020.  “The operational decision is based on the public health orders and the fundamental response that police have to enforce those health orders,” he said.  “We want people to take the responsibility, share the responsibility. And what we know is that at this moment, it is a crucial time for the community, the police and health to work together.”  The police response will include additional officers as well as mounted police, the dog squad and PolAir surveillance.  Some 21 of Friday’s reported cases were in south-west Sydney. However, there are also emerging hotspots in Sydney’s south-east, with eight cases in that area.  Democracy in Colour head Neha Madhok said the police response was “thinly veiled racism” and targeted people of colour and working-class communities.  -with AAP  Please choose a reason below: ",uncredited,155874-72667,Regional News,Web,,The New Daily,The New Daily,https://thenewdaily.com.au,2021-07-09 04:40:43,https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/coronavirus/2021/07/09/sydney-lockdown-rules/,Oceania,,Australia,,en,1631145,,-39,4,Negative,1,,,,1,,,,,0.5,50,1,6.6,6.07195228797191

Dominic Lipinski/PA Wire   A trade body has warned there could be increased abuse towards store workers as restrictions are eased.   Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has said staff in shops could face an increase in abuse and violence.   The boss said the Government must provide clear guidance to the sector over plans to end the legal requirement to wear masks in stores to avoid confrontations, and added that retailers are expected to keep hand sanitiser and screens in stores to protect staff.   She said: “Our primary concern is that Government messaging is clear about what is regulation and what is advisory so that people understand what's expected of them, and that people are tolerant and allow others to make their own personal choices.   “There has been a big rise in violence and abuse against retail workers during the pandemic and colleagues cannot be put in the firing line because of this change in policy.”   The chief added: “Retailers will have many people in their stores who want to continue wearing masks, and many who don't, and will have to accommodate everyone.”   Her comments come as several retailers weigh up whether to continue asking customers to wear masks in stores beyond the July 19 date when the Government is expected to relax the vast majority of Covid-19 restrictions.   Sainsbury's boss Simon Roberts said earlier this week that he would consult with staff but suggested the decision on masks would be one of “personal choice”.   The PA news agency understands that supermarket chains Morrisons and Aldi are among retailers requesting more detailed guidance soon.   Meanwhile, Tesco is understood to be currently undertaking an internal review into its mask-wearing policy following the Government update on Monday evening.   On Monday, Boris Johnson said the Government is planning to halt the legal requirement regarding face coverings.   He did however add that he would wear a face covering in crowded places and as a matter of courtesy.   Other ministers have subsequently said they would be “carrying” masks and would wear them in certain circumstances.   England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty also said on Monday he would continue wearing a mask “in any situation that was indoors and was crowded, or indoors and in close proximity to other people”.   The BRC's warning comes as retailers and other businesses are concerned that plans to keep self-isolation rules in place until August would also have an impact on workers who would be forced to stay home.   Hospitality chiefs have warned that the delay between restrictions being lifted and the self-isolation rules being eased risks “the summer being cancelled and vast swathes of the population unnecessarily confined to their homes”.   Kate Nicholls, boss of trade body UKHospitality, said: “This is not just a hospitality issue – it is affecting the whole economy and we need an earlier test to release system in place.”   Ms Dickinson, of the BRC, added: “We are already seeing a serious impact on retail operations as a result of staff having to self-isolate and this will only get worse right across the economy, as cases are already rising fast and the final restrictions are eased.”   Updates in your area sent directly to your email inbox   We connect you with the people and communities that matter to your business   Contribute to your community by becoming an area ambassador   Search for trusted local businesses near you ",Lucy Hilton,13362-65966,Regional News,Web,General News,InYourArea,InYourArea,https://www.inyourarea.co.uk,2021-07-09 10:03:54,https://www.inyourarea.co.uk/news/mask-rule-change-risks-rise-in-abuse-towards-shop-workers/,Europe,Western Europe,United Kingdom,,en,7306343,,17,6,Positive,0,,,1,,,,,"This is a issue from the goverment, no Aldi.

Here's where to buy an England shirt to show your support   England fans bursting with pride have flooded the internet in search of the team's Euro 2020 home shirt after the Three Lions booked a place in the final of the 2021 tournament.   Gareth Southgate's stars got the better of Denmark in a nail-biting semi final encounter played under the Wembley Stadium arch and in front of £60,000 spectators on Wednesday 8 July.   And, while the memories and stories of 1966 live on, England's current crop of superstars will be hoping to write a new chapter in the annals of football belonging to the country that invented it.   Just as the red shirt England's heroes wore that day became synonymous with the 1966 World Cup triumph, demand for the Three Lions' kit worn at Euro 2020 has skyrocketed overnight.   Unfortunately, stock at Tesco, Aldi, and Asda have been completely depleted -they're sold out of English kit at time of writing. But there are still places you can pick up the iconic kit.   Here's the latest stock listing of the replica England home, away and goalkeeper shirts worn by Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Mason Mount, Kalvin Phillips, Harry Maguire and Co.   Sports Direct   The white England home kit is only available in women's size 8 (£69.99) and junior ages 7-10 (£54.99) through Sports Direct.   The retailer is still showing stock of the yellow England goalkeeper top, a replica of the top worn by Jordan Pickford, in men's size small for a crisp £74.99.   There are also third kit tops - the blue one - available in men's size small for £99.99, women's size 10 for £69.99 and junior ages 7-8 for £54.99.   Buy now   JD Sports   England's home shirt is available in junior size small at JD Sports for £55.   The Three Lions' third kit (blue) is also in stock in junior size extra small for the same price.

Surprising? Not really. Along with prosecco and New Zealand sauvignon blanc, Provence rosé has been the big success story of the past decade, with sales up by 51% in the past year alone.                    And it’s not only at supermarkets. Pubs and restaurants sell it by the bucketload, even when they have cheaper rosés on offer. “I have never found the price of Provence rosé to be a barrier,” says Piers Baker of the heavily wine-focused The Sun Inn at Dedham in Essex. “The attraction is the colour, obviously, but it’s also clean, fresh and undemanding. When people order it they know what they are going to get, which isn’t necessarily true of other wines.”                   It makes sense for the producers too, who have found it more profitable to sell rosé that can be released early rather than reds that have to spend time maturing in oak. “When I worked in Bandol in the early 1990s, red wine accounted for the majority of sales,” says Jason Yapp, who sells the high end Mas de la Rouvière rosé for almost the same price as the winery’s red. “Today it is 73% rosé, 22% red and 5% white.”                   It might be tempting to dismiss expensive rosé as a cynical rip-off, but there’s no reason why well-crafted rosé shouldn’t merit the same price tag as a well-made red or white. That said, price (as with champagne) is as often related to a celebrity endorsement or a fancy bottle. Maison No 9, which is also available in jeroboams, is a collaboration with American rapper Post Malone. Kylie has her own Provence rosé (for £22 from Harvey Nichols or £15 from Morrisons) which sells for almost twice the price of her basic French rosé, while the team behind the wildly successful Whispering Angel has brought out a second wine, The Palm (below), which wouldn’t look out of place by an LA pool.                   If you’re willing to forgo the Provence name, there is better value to be had elsewhere in the south of France. While a shade pinker, Rosé de Balthazar (see today’s picks) is currently about half the price of many Provence rosés, while bargain central Aldi stocks a stylish Ventoux along with the Côtes du Luberon rosé I recommended the other week. As with other types of wine, it pays to shop around.                                                               Five                        southern French rosés to impress the neighbours                                                                                Le Rosé de Balthazar 2020, Languedoc                                                           £5.99 (on offer) Waitrose, 12.5%. Looks and tastes much more expensive than it is. Not Provençal, but could be.                                        Lafage miraflors rosé 2020 Côtes Catalanes                                      £10.99 (on offer) Simply Wines Direct, £11.59 allaboutwine.co.uk, 12.5%. There’s a wide discrepancy in prices of this glamorous, frosted bottle, which comes from down on the Spanish border, but these are the best deals. Fresh and citrussy, with a lovely touch of wild strawberry.                                        Aldi Specially Selected Ventoux Rosé                                                           £6.99, 13%. From the Rhône rather than Provence, but who could tell? A real steal.                                        The Palm Rosé by Whispering Angel 2020                                      £13.95 Vineyards Direct, £14.99 Waitrose Cellar, £15 Tesco, 12.5%. If you’re a fan of Whispering Angel, you’ll jump at this slightly cheaper version, clearly designed to be sipped by a pool.                                        Domaine Tempier Bandol Rosé 2020                                      13% £13.20 a half-bottle Mayfly Wine Co, full bottles from £29.99 Lea & Sandeman, 13%. One of the most iconic rosés. Perfect with Provençal food and can also be aged. Half-bottles are particularly tempting, if you can nail one.                   • For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com                 ",Fiona Beckett,74359159,National News,Web,,Guardian News and Media Ltd,theguardian.com,http://www.theguardian.com,2021-07-09 00:00:00,https://www.nla-eclipsweb.com/service/redirector/article/74359159.pdf,Europe,,United Kingdom,,en,111481021,,10,5,Neutral,1,,,1,,,,,,1,16.6666666666667,10,29.3333333333333,217.002396945386

Sign up here to get the complete newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Wednesday and Friday   Dear readers,   Break out the beers and Pringles, even in Asia. Fans there will have their eyes glued to their televisions early on Monday morning for a global sporting spectacle. The European Football Championship concludes this weekend in London. The final between England and Italy should be one of the most-watched sporting events of all time.   Chinese companies have noted the interest at home. Television maker Hisense has been joined on the billboards by TikTok, Vivo and Alipay. Meanwhile, neither Facebook, Google nor Amazon appear on the official partners list.   But off the pitch, the real tussle this week was between Didi Chuxing and Beijing. The Chinese ride-hailing group became the latest target of a clampdown in China just days after raising $4.4bn in the year's biggest initial public offering.   Watchdogs there cited data security worries for the moves. But Lex thought another reason existed: annoyance at the flood of US initial public offerings by homegrown groups. Two other Chinese companies that listed in New York last month are also being probed by regulators.   Beijing's message is being heard loud and clear. LinkDoc, a medical data company backed by Alibaba, cancelled its New York listing on Thursday, a day after closing its order book.   All this has taught American investors a lesson. Shares in Didi now trade 20 per cent below the $14 IPO price. None of this is a good look for the Wall Street banks that underwrote the deal.   Lex noted prudent bankers and bosses would only have launched US IPOs after taking soundings from Chinese officials. They either spoke to the wrong people or the mood changed radically. Either way, the lawsuits from shareholders against Didi have already started flying.   The attack on Didi means US banks will see far less fees coming from Chinese listings in the US in the second half of the year. But short-term, investment banking revenues will continue to impress. Chinese listings aside, the market for IPOs shows no sign of losing its sizzle. Companies have raised more than $85bn since the start of the year, a record for the period, according to Refinitiv.   Even so, JPMorgan Chase is not sitting still. The US bank is making bets through acquisitions wherever it can. Since the start of 2021, it has struck more than 30 deals, including the £700m purchase of UK wealth manager Nutmeg. The problem, however, is that almost all of these deals have been tiny for a company with a $460bn market cap.   They are either hedges, opportunities for knowledge sharing or straight investments. As Lex said: “They demonstrate why traditional banking has not managed to excite investors, even as the businesses thrive.” Then again, things could be worse. Singapore struggles to attract new listings, Lex pointed out.   Jamie Dimon is not the only one on the prowl for deals. Bob Diamond, the former Barclays head, has struck a deal for Circle, the company behind digital currency USD Coin. He plans to merge it with his New York-listed blank cheque company at an enterprise value of $4.5bn. Lex was sceptical. To hit its lofty financial targets, not only must digital money go mainstream, Circle must emerge as a winner too.   Over in the UK, a trio of private investment groups led by SoftBank-owned Fortress this week struck a £9.5bn deal to acquire Wm Morrison, Britain's fourth-largest supermarket chain.   Supermarkets have notoriously thin margins. But small increments in operating margins and exit prices can yield fat gains for leveraged purchasers. Lex crunched the numbers. The consortium led by Fortress would buy Morrisons at 8.5 times ebitda. If they sold at a multiple of 9.5 times in a few years, they should achieve a 20 per cent annualised return on a £3bn equity investment.   But this is not a done deal. Rival buyout firm Apollo has considered a potential counterbid. Whichever private equity group ends up winning, the victor will pit its style of private ownership against listed chains such as J Sainsbury and Tesco, and the family-controlled German interlopers Aldi and Lidl. As Lex noted, family groups worry less about short-term targets than quoted businesses. Through aggressive pricing, the German discounters have increased their UK market share to just over 14 per cent.   Finally, another global ransomware attack that affected more than 1,000 companies reminds us that cyber crimes grow ever larger, more damaging and pricier. The cost to insure against such attacks is rising.   Even so, Lex found that this is hardly juicy business for insurers. Of the top-two standalone cyber security underwriters last year, Axa barely washed its face and AIG dipped into losses. The industry as a whole had a loss ratio of 73 per cent on an aggregate $1.6bn of direct written premiums, according to S&P data.   Let's hope hackers prefer watching the football and leave everything alone this weekend. Enjoy yourselves, whatever you do.

These interns, students working on their therapy degrees, will offer services both pro bono and on a sliding scale.   The decision to add these new members comes under the auspices of Natty, a fully trained EMDR therapist , with the goal of making this beneficial therapy available to more clients in need of emotional healing. EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy is one of the newer modalities designed to provide relief from trauma. The efficacy of this therapy has shown clinically and research-based success in releasing emotional trauma and is supported by the World Health Organization and the APA, American Psychological Association.   Natty serves as the Director of Pro Bono & Sliding Scale Services, and will supervise the Internship Program. The new University residents participating include:   • Alexandria Green, Kendra Tate, Nathan Sterry, and Roberto Lopez Adrian, Millersville University   • Curtis Wilson and Wes Wilson, Capella University   • Kimberly Romero, Messiah University   • Vanessa Hofer, University of Pennsylvania   • Kaylisha Estevez, Edinboro University   • Gwen Burns, Shippensburg University   Interns offering therapeutic services on a sliding scale means more residents of Lancaster residents from all income levels can now afford to receive the guidance they need, in a professionally supervised environment. Their individual and couple-centered approach to therapy and counseling help clients create more happiness and fulfillment in a safe, confidential setting.   Shadena Natty, for her part, is ensuring the citizens of Lancaster County obtain the highest possible therapeutic care. She has done so with the creation of the training, support and mentor programs for the entire Sun Point Wellness practice.   “We at Sun Point are dedicated to quality care for our clients and anyone who is looking for quality therapy, ” said Natty. “Offering additional services on a sliding scale, through our internship program, will be invaluable to the health of our community here in Lancaster.”   Breesha Comish , Executive Director of Clinical Services at Sun Point Wellness, is pleased to see the team fulfilling their goals to help the Lancaster community by offering affordable therapy services at Sun Point Wellness Center.   “I am thrilled to announce Shadena Natty is successfully leading the effort to provide affordable, premier, evidence-based clinical services to Lancaster county citizens,” said Breesha Comish. “She has developed a comprehensive training and support program, along with a mentor program to allow for optimal client care.”   Interns providing Pro Bono and Sliding Scale Services for therapy and counseling will be available for the 2021-2022 Academic Year.

Do these things happen to other people? Is this what happened to Amelia Earhart? Are they going to find her sitting at a computer saying, “Where did the last 84 years ago? Why did I get on this plane?” I’ve been waiting for things to quiet down so I could record Gord's Gold but it never has. When the apartment upstairs gets quiet there’s noise from the street. I’ll try recording when I get home tonight if it’s not too late. Yes I’m actually going out tonight for a real live Irish Session at Mary O’s. I’m going to hear live music, eat pub food, and meet Caitlin and Chris who I have only seen on streaming shows. I even have a gift certificate so I can afford the pub food. I love pub food. If anyone wants to join me come to Mary O’s, the show starts at 8:00. As I’ve been home, the most exciting things going on have been food. I made the Dangerous Pork Tenderloin last night and it came out perfect. I can’t do that every time without the air fryer. The best thing is that I can cook the homemade potato chips with it on the same sheet for the same amount of time. I love when the timing works out. To crisp the chips, I put the temperature up to 450 for the five minutes that the pork cools before I cut it. I’m hungry just thinking about it. The Aldi peppercorn pork tenderloin is so good, and it costs me less than $1 a meal. Last night I was supposed to see Nicole Atkins, but Thor prevented that. Some people would blame Tropical Storm Elsa, but you can’t put blame on an inanimate phenomenon. You can’t even call it an object. Just because we give storms names, does not make them rational beings capable of moral culpability. People For that we need to blame the mighty God of Thunder. He must not be a music lover. I can’t believe people are so irrational as to blame a storm. I take a scientific world view and blame the god that controls the weather. Storms don’t cancel concerts, gods cancel concerts. I planned out and scripted Gord's Gold even though I have not been able to record it yet. I end it with a tribute to Martin Swinger who died earlier this week. I already eulogized him here but there were somethings that I wanted to say on air but don’t have time for. More importantly Gord's Gold is not the best place for my thoughts on thanatology. Thanatology is the study of death from the Greek thanos. Both Thor and Thanos made it into today’s Wise Madness; it still won’t be a blockbuster. I’m an atheist so I think that Martin has returned to the same place he was before he was born, non-existence, the same fate that awaits us all. That’s not good and it’s not bad. Non-existence is the epitome neutrality. When we mourn the dead, we mourn the void they leave in our lives. That is real and it’s undeniable. If there is an afterlife I cannot imagine any deity consigning Martin to anything but the best possibility. Yahweh would send him to heaven. Catholic Yahweh would not make him stop in purgatory. Allah would send him to paradise, The Valkyrie would take him to Asgard where he’d have a word with Thor about canceling concerts. If the Hindus and Buddhists are right he’ll be reincarnated as the happiest animal in the Hungry Pond the setting of the musical he was working on. Now I should start getting ready for my night out. I’d love for you to join me.",horvendile2,1226524301895,Social Comments,Social,,WordPress,Wise Madness,https://wisemadness2.wordpress.com,2021-07-09 00:00:00,http://ct.moreover.com/?a=45351420864&p=1a1&v=1&x=Cmyx3L_QFhvtB1pZ7t3ZTw,,,Other / Unknown,,en,1000,,0,5,Neutral,1,,,1,,,,1,,0.5,100,0.5,6.05,40.0589880785358

The new cases were diagnosed from over 42,000 tests in the 24 hours to 8pm on Friday, and include 26 who were active in the community for part of their infectious period.  ""When you know that there are 26 cases infectious in the community, the only conclusion we can draw is that things are going to get worse before they get better.  She again appealed for Sydneysiders to stop bending the lockdown rules, citing at least two people who police caught throwing parties overnight.  ""The vast majority of those (new) cases - and I can't stress this enough - are close family or friends of people who have COVID,"" she told reporters.  ""If you truly love your parents, your sisters, your best friends, please stick to the rules.""  Some 44 cases were recorded the day before, marking the worst day of the current virus outbreak and prompting the premier to warn lockdown will likely be extended again.  The premier said a premature reopening of Greater Sydney would result in thousands of coronavirus cases, hospitalisations and deaths.  Tough new rules, limiting exercise to groups of two and banning browsing at shops, also came into effect on Friday at 5pm, as the state's health department on Friday issued more alerts for retail stores across Sydney.  Among them are Woolworths stores in Mascot and Ashfield, Aldi stores in Hoxton Park, Quakers Hill and Ashfield, a Beacon Lighting shop in Bankstown, and KFC in Rockdale.  Several places are listed close contact exposure sites for periods of seven hours or longer.  They include an Ikea at Tempe, where a staffer worked whilst infectious, and a construction site at Homebush.  Seven furniture stores along the same road in Campbelltown have also been identified as venues of concern for visitors on Sunday afternoon.  The new restrictions also permit only one person per household to leave the home for shopping each day, and limit funerals to 10 people.

0,Aldi,9012751481,web,2021-07-10,2021-07-10 03:08:37,opoint,Forget winter - BBQ season is coming!,"  Summer is coming – here’s to a wonderful one to come.I love the al fresco lifestyle (yes, I know, Ireland might not be the first choice) and currently, Mr T and I are transforming our back garden into an oasis.  The garden shed is nicely painted and I am adding little eye catching features to make it look like a beach hut (no, I am not living near the beach).  The BBQ got a nice scrub and my brain is searching already for ideas on how to create the first ‘barbie’ of the year.  There will be the burger (it seems there can’t be a BBQ without a burger) – homemade of course. Last year, Aldi had mini burger buns, which are perfect for any attending children (avoids a lot of unfinished burgers going in the bin) and I made small burgers, added a bit of cheese and lettuce, stuck a cocktail umbrella in it and had happy kids all around.  Lamb is very underrated when it comes to the ol’ BBQ – marinated with rosemary, garlic and herbs, it makes perfect skewers.  As much as I love fish, I have never barbecued it – so this year I will make use of the fish holder we got a few years ago and try to grill a lovely trout stuffed with herbs and lemon (mouthwatering). Prawns are also perfect for grilling, as they don’t need long.  And for the vegetarians, I love haloumi cheese. Cut into slices (or cubes if you like to skewer the cheese), I marinate the cheese in lime juice and zest, red chili and mint – the result is just beautiful.  For the more serious vegetarian, a bean burger is always a good alternative (packed with loads of veggies, you might even be able to fool the kids).  For sides, I simply love potato salad (go to biasasta.ie and click on the German Files for my favourite recipe) but the old favourite coleslaw is always a winner (and so easy to make yourself).  Or what about a platter of grilled vegetables?  Asparagus, courgettes, corn on the cob, baby potatoes and aubergines are perfect, especially when drizzled with either a herb butter or a nice garlicky yogurt.  Talking about BBQs, there is a strong debate on every year on what type of BBQ you should be using: gas or charcoal.  Now, there is something to be said for each (and we actually have both versions at home) - gas means you don’t have to discard the ashes at the end of the event, you can control the heat easier and you won’t have as much smoke (unless you let the fat of the meat drip down).  Charcoal on the other hand gives you that smoky flavour that gas just can’t give you.  I grew up with a dad who loved gathering his family and friends around for a good barbecue. My mum and I worked away in the kitchen, marinating the meat, preparing the vegetables, making the salads and so on. My dad then turned up when everything was done, lit the charcoal and placed the meat, turning it masterfully and everyone congratulated him on the ‘hard’ work he did to feed his guests.  He never saw the irony of that to be honest - he was proud that the meat was juicy and the burgers didn’t fall apart when turning. In case you would like to upgrade your grilling skills, I will be hosting a summer entertainment workshop with Siobhan at the Wooden Spoons Cookery School soon.  All we need now is a great summer (as I am writing this article, it is lashing outside!).

Many of the city's most popular venues in west and south-west Sydney – including a Bupa Dental store, Chemist Warehouse, KFC, Chemistworks, 7-Eleven, Woolworths and Oporto – have made it onto NSW Health's latest list of Covid sites, published on Saturday evening.   Residents who visited Direct Trade in Merrylands on Saturday July 3 between 2.20pm and 2.50pm, Freshness 4 Less in Fairfield the following day between 12 and 1pm, and Benedict Recycling in Chipping Norton on Monday July 5 from 10.50am to 12pm are a close contact of a known case and will need to isolate for 14 days after getting tested.   After a record-high day of Covid cases, Sydney has been hit with a new list of exposure sites right across the city   A Bunnings Warehouse at Padstow was listed as an exposure site for Sunday July 4   Meanwhile a Barbecues Galore at Penrith was listed and anyone who visited on Tuesday July 6 between 3 to 3.15pm is considered a close contact   The same rules apply for residents who walked into a Barbecues Galore on Tuesday July 6 in Penrith from 3 to 3.15pm, the Butcher Shed in Moorebank Shopping Centre on the same day from 1pm until 1.15pm, Bupa Dental in Miranda on Wednesday July 7 from 10.50am to 12.10pm and Chemist Warehouse in Punchbowl on Thursday July 8 from 9.20am to 9.40am.   A further 22 venues were listed on the government's Twitter page in suburbs including Coogee, Maroubra, Padstow, Sans Souci, Menai and Revesby, cementing the state's worst fears – many of our favourite retailers have been affected right across the city and its surrounding suburbs.   One of Sydney's most popular shopping centres was put on alert earlier in the day after a confirmed Covid-19 case visited several of its stores.   Locations around Sydney are baren and Liverpool is no different, as only one man was seen out on this street walking with a mask on   This Liverpool store owner said he had no customers all day, as people follow the lockdown conditions applied to Sydney by the NSW Government   A Liverpool market was also completely abandoned as Police launch a high visibility operation across south-west Sydney   Broadway Sydney revealed an infected shopper had visited the centre's Kmart, JB Hi Fi, Coles, Aldi, Harvey Norman and Liquorland stores on Thursday, July 8 between 12pm to 2pm.   Anyone who visited the centre as a whole during those times has been urged to get tested if symptoms appear and isolate until a negative result.   ‘NSW Health has advised that the customer was diligent in wearing a mask and checking in at all locations and we thank all of our customers who continue to do this to assist NSW Health in their contact tracing efforts,' the centre said.

Advertisement   McDonald's at Sans Souci was announced as an exposure site on Saturday evening after Sydney recorded 50 new Covid cases   Chemist Warehouse in Punchbowl, below an Anytime Fitness, is an exposure site on Thursday July 8   Broadway Sydney revealed an infected shopper had visited the centre's Kmart, JB Hi Fi, Coles, ALDI, Harvey Norman and Liquorland stores on July 8 between 12pm to 2pm   Among the stores visited by the infected case include the Aldi at Broadway Sydney Shopping Centre   The infected shopper also stopped by the Jb Hi Fi store at Broadway on July 8   ‘The Centre undergoes a full deep clean each night as part of our regular cleaning regime introduced at the onset of the pandemic to assist in protecting our community and will undertake additional measures following the confirmation of a contact.'   New South Wales recorded 50 new coronavirus cases on Saturday following three-consecutive days of record numbers as the premier warned ‘things are going to get worse before they get better'.   Premier Gladys Berejiklian confirmed the new cases in a press conference in Sydney after introducing further restrictions on the current stay-at-home-orders on Friday.   She says ‘most concerningly' there were 26 active cases in the community, saying too many residents were ‘cutting corners' and ‘flouting the rules'.   ‘That is the number we need to get down to as close to zero as possible,' Ms Berejiklian said.   ‘When you know that there are 26 cases infectious in the community, the only conclusion we can draw is that things are going to get worse before they get better.'   She also hinted that the Greater Sydney lockdown, which is entering its third week, is likely to be extended.   Sydney's once bustling waterfront is now eerily quiet, as people follow NSW lockdown restrictions   Sydney's Luna Park is closed, in accordance to NSW lockdown restrictions as Sydney are fighting to contain the delta variant of coronavirus   ‘I think it is pretty clear that unless we reduce that level of people in the community that are infectious, we won't be able to turn things around as quickly as we can or as quickly as we should,' the premier said.   Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said there are 47 people in hospital being treated for the virus with 16 in intensive care including a teenager, a person in their 20s and person in their 30s.   Of the 47 in hospital, 37 were unvaccinated. No one that has been double vaccinated is currently in hospital.   Police issued more than 160 fines for breaching protocol in the last 24 hours, including eight people being busted for throwing a house party in Sydney's east.   NEW: USE DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA'S TRACKER TO FIND THE LATEST EXPOSURE SITES NEAR YOU   Broadway's Coles supermarket was also visited by the infected shopper on Thursday   New South Wales recorded 50 new coronavirus cases on Saturday after three-consecutive days of record numbers   Premier Gladys Berejiklian confirmed the new cases in a press conference in Sydney after introducing further restrictions on the current stay-at-home-orders on Friday   Premier Berejiklian refused to be drawn into comments about extending the Greater Sydney lockdown but said she expects cases ‘to get worse before they get better'   Ms Berejiklian lamented people giving misleading or untruthful information when being contacted by NSW Health officials, pleading for Sydneysiders to be honest with their actions and exposure.   ‘One message I really want to get across to people who have been diagnosed with COVID, please tell us the truth the first time around,' she said.   ‘When people withhold information, it means that their contacts are infectious – potentially infectious in the community. Eventually our health contact tracers get to the truth.   ‘Please tell the truth from the first minute rather than after repeated conversations, because otherwise you put your closest family and friends at the greatest risk, and that is something we don't want to see.'   A woman is seen walking through Fairfield on Saturday as cases surge in the south-west   NSW Police has warned Sydneysiders they'll be on high alert over the coming days ensuring residents are following public health orders   There were 38 new cases announced Thursday and 44 Friday.   Saturday's figure deepens the growing crisis with the highly-infectious Delta strain.   There are currently 47 people who have been hospitalised as a result of the virus, with Dr Chant urging people to take it seriously.   ‘I'm making an impassioned plea for the community this weekend to follow the advice we've provided, and I think — diligently the advice we've provided and I think you will understand my growing level of concern that we need to bring these case numbers down,' she said.   ‘I think what we are seeing is chains of transmission and we are having difficulty getting ahead of those chains.'   She confirmed the teenager currently suffering from the virus in ICU is not on a ventilator.   Police confirmed 167 fines were handed out in the last 24 hours, including a party in Randwick in Sydney's east involving eight men.   There was also a party in The Entrance on the Central Coast involving five adults and a minor.   Out of the fines, 67 came from Sydney's south-west – an area being targeted extensively by police to attempt to slow the virus' spread.   Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said police will continue their high-visibility movement in the suburbs despite claims of racism and double standards.   There were 72 people fined for failing to wear masks and 96 for leaving home without a reasonable excuse.   Ms Berejiklian lamented people giving misleading or untruthful information when being contacted by NSW Health officials, pleading for Sydneysiders to be honest with their actions and exposure   There were 38 new cases announced Thursday and 44 Friday, both the highest days recorded since the start of the pandemic   ‘I think it is pretty clear that unless we reduce that level of people in the community that are infectious, we won't be able to turn things around as quickly as we can or as quickly as we should,' the premier said   Sydney's weather is set to be a boost for officials in containing the virus spreading further as rain lashes the Harbour City   The announcement comes as five million Sydneysiders could be stuck in lockdown until at least August, a leading infectious disease expert has claimed.   Professor Mary-Louise McLaws said it would take ‘at least a month' to get Covid numbers down and even longer to eliminate community transmission completely.   ‘You expect cases, sadly, in family clusters, but the ones outside isolation are the ones that are telling you there's a lot of circulating virus,' she told Weekend Today.   ‘My projections are that it's going to take at least a month to get those down.'   Professor McLaws said it was concerning to see over half of the new Covid cases detected not having isolated.   ‘At the moment that (proportion has) been very high, anywhere between a half of all people diagnosed to 60 per cent – and that has to get down to zero.'   Her grim warning comes as tensions mount in south-west Sydney, where 100 extra police officers have been sent to ensure compliance in worrying Covid hotspots.   Furious residents in the targeted local government areas – Fairfield, Canterbury-Bankstown and Liverpool – have questioned why Sydney's eastern suburbs are not receiving the same police attention.   Under the tough new rules, which came into effect at 5pm on Friday, exercise is limited to groups of two, browsing is banned at shops and residents can still only leave their homes for one of the four essential reasons.   Mary-Louise McLaws, professor of epidemiology at UNSW, claimed it could be five weeks before community transmission of the Indian Delta variant of Covid 19 slows in Sydney   Sydney could be in lockdown until at least August, as tensions mount over extra police attention in the city's Covid-hit west and south-west ",uncredited,264271-521678,Regional News,Web,,Newsfeeds,Newsfeeds,https://newsfeeds.media/,2021-07-10 12:39:52,https://newsfeeds.media/covid-lockdown-sydney-two-medical-centres-commonwealth-bank-and-a-kmart-flagged-as-exposure-sites/,North America,,United States,,en,44371,,0,5,Neutral,1,,,1,,,,,COVID-19 List of exposures sites.

""The only conclusion we can draw is that things are going to get worse before they get better,"" Ms Berejiklian told reporters on Saturday, after announcing 50 new infections in the previous 24-hour period.  The lockdown of Greater Sydney is due to end on July 16.  But with the proportion of new cases are already in isolation - and therefore no risk - falling every day, the premier warned restrictions were likely to be extended.  Thirty-seven of the 50 cases recorded in the 24 hours to 8pm on Friday were active in the community for all or part of their infectious period.  It was the highest daily number of cases in NSW since the pandemic's first wave in early 2020.  Some 47 COVID-19 patients in NSW have been admitted to hospital. Sixteen of them, including a teenager, are in intensive care, while four are ventilated, including one person in their 20s.  NSW Health on Saturday evening issued numerous alerts for venues of concern, stretching across Sydney's eastern, western, southwestern, southeastern and northwestern suburbs.  They include Coles at Kareela, a KFC in Rockdale, Penrith Barbeques Galore, a Bunnings in Padstow and a popular cafe in Centennial Park.  The busy Broadway Shopping Centre in Ultimo posted on social media it had been alerted to a COVID-positive shopper who visited on Thursday.  Several major outlets, including Aldi, Kmart and JB Hi-Fi, were visited by the case and NSW Health on Saturday evening listed the centre as a venue of concern.  Full details on the latest restrictions and venues of concern can be found at www.nsw.gov.au.  As case numbers grow, Ms Berejiklian has urged Sydneysiders to stop bending the lockdown rules.  ""The vast majority of those (new) cases are close family or friends of people who have COVID,"" she told reporters.  ""If you truly love your parents, your sisters, your best friends, please stick to the rules.""  After a further update to the public health orders, Sydneysiders are now required to wear masks in all indoor areas of construction sites.  Face coverings will also be required in lifts and lobbies of apartment blocks from July 13.  The new rules come after city-wide restrictions were tightened on Friday afternoon, with exercise now limited to groups of two and only one person per day from each household allowed to leave the house to go shopping.

La société affirme que la nouvelle gamme de hamburgers pour supermarchés est une première en son genre au Royaume-Uni.   Les hamburgers sont offerts en paquet de deux pour 2,69 £ et seront disponibles dans les magasins du pays à partir du jeudi 15 juillet.   Parfaits pour le barbecue, ces premiers hamburgers d'agneau de supermarché ont été lancés après qu'il a été révélé que le Tikka Masala est le curry de choix pour plus d'un tiers (38%) des Britanniques, le plaçant fermement comme le favori du pays !   Assaisonnée d'épices tandoor aromatiques traditionnelles, la viande succulente est pleine de saveurs pour le plaisir des clients.   Les hamburgers sont livrés en pack de deux pour 2,69 £. (Aldi)   La chaîne de supermarchés a même dressé une liste d'ingrédients pour que les acheteurs puissent savourer les hamburgers de la meilleure façon possible.   Le détaillant allemand recommande d'associer les hamburgers à l'agneau Tikka Masala avec des pains à hamburger briochés spécialement sélectionnés (0,95 £, 200 g) et d'ajouter le chutney de mangue Bilash sucré, disponible pour 1,09 £.   Le supermarché a déclaré que l'ajout de croustillants Bilash Plain Poppadums (0,79 £, 64 g) et de la sélection de collations indiennes Let's Party d'Aldi (2,49 £, 504 g) aiderait à créer le festin d'inspiration indienne ultime que toute la famille peut apprécier – sans se ruiner.   Bien que la chaîne de supermarchés ait averti, les clients devront être rapides car les hamburgers ne sont disponibles que pour une durée limitée.

He said the NSW government may also make use of federal income support platforms to administer state government-funded financial assistance, if required.  The lockdown of Greater Sydney is due to end on July 16 but both Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Treasurer Dominic Perrottet have in recent days admitted it will likely be extended.  NSW recorded 50 new local COVID-19 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Friday, 37 of which were active in the community for all or part of their infectious period.  Some 16 COVID-19 patients are currently in intensive care, with four ventilated.  Mr Perrottet on Sunday said he expected the lockdown provisions to be extended and this would, in the absence of JobKeeper, cause major damage to businesses and workers.  He said the government would thus be obliged to splash more cash on assistance, and that a second business support package would be announced later this week.  NSW has already spent $1.4 billion on business support amid the current lockdown.  ""Last year there didn't seem to be any light at the end of the tunnel whereas now the vaccine program is rolling out across the state - this gives hope this will hopefully be the last time we have to go through this,"" Mr Perrottet told Sky News.  ""We're going to have to do more, that's just the reality.""  Mr Perrottet was reportedly opposed to the extension of the initial two-week lockdown in Greater Sydney and surrounds due to its effect on business.  While he acknowledged on Sunday that NSW could not currently let the virus run rampant through the community due to low vaccination rates, he said Australians would one day need to adjust and accept the presence of COVID-19 in the community.  ""At some point in time we will be opening up the international borders - we can't be living here on the other side of the world as a backwater,"" Mr Perrottet said.  NSW Health on Saturday issued numerous alerts for venues of concern across Sydney.  They include Coles at Kareela, a KFC in Rockdale, Penrith Barbeques Galore, a Bunnings in Padstow and a popular cafe in Centennial Park.  The busy Broadway Shopping Centre in Ultimo posted on social media it had been alerted to a COVID-positive shopper who visited on Thursday.  Several major outlets, including Aldi, Kmart and JB Hi-Fi, were visited by the case and NSW Health on Saturday evening listed the centre as a venue of concern.  As case numbers grow, Ms Berejiklian urged Sydneysiders to adhere to lockdown rules.  ""The vast majority of those (new) cases are close family or friends of people who have COVID,"" she told reporters on Saturday.  ""If you truly love your parents, your sisters, your best friends, please stick to the rules.""  After a further update to public health orders, Sydneysiders are now required to wear masks in all indoor areas of construction sites and common areas of apartment blocks.  The new rules come after city-wide restrictions were tightened on Friday afternoon, with exercise now limited to groups of two and only one person per day from each household allowed to leave the house to go shopping.

People who have been to Coles in Kareela and Roselands must get tested and isolate for 14 days, after NSW Health on Saturday evening issued alerts for 19 exposure sites, predominantly in southwestern Sydney.  Alerts for Broadway Shopping Centre in Ultimo, Commonwealth Bank in Kogarah and Kmart in Roselands have also been issued.  It comes as NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet concedes the lockdown was “very likely” to be extended beyond Friday, and said Australians would eventually need to learn to “live alongside” Covid-19.  Mr Perrottet he insisted it was “unstainable” to maintain the indefinite threat of lockdowns once vaccination rates increased, saying the UK and US showed it was not possible to “eliminate Covid from society”.  “I know people find that an uncomfortable thing to accept, but that’s just the reality,” he told Sky News.  “We’ve got to get to a point in time where those who want to have a vaccine, get access to one. And at that point, we’ve got to open up our society, and have the freedoms that we had operating prior to the pandemic.”  The latest venues of concern are:  Belmore  Belmore Medical Centre  Between 6:30pm-7:15pm on Mon, 5 July  Greenacre  St Peters Cafe on Wentworth  Between 6am-6:30am on Mon, 5 July  Greenacre Medical Practice  Between 11:40am-1:50pm on Mon, 5 July and 12:40pm-1:45pm on Tues, 6 July  Your Discount Chemist  Between 2pm-2:15pm on Mon, 5 July and 1:55pm-2:05pm on Tues, July 6  Hoxton Park  Aldi  Between 3:30pm-4pm on Mon, 5 July  Chemist Warehouse Westfield Hurstville  Between 2:25pm-3:15pm on Tues, 6 July  Kareela  Coles Kareela  Between 5pm-10pm on Friday, 2 July and 5pm-10pm on Tuesday, 6 July  Kensington  Stable Talk Cafe  Between 11am-11:30am on Sat, 3 July  Kogarah  Commonwealth Bank  Between 3:05pm-3:35pm on Mon, 5 July  Maroubra  Chemist Warehouse  Between 9:55am-10:30am on Mon, 5 July  Penrith  BBQ Galore  Between 2:30pm-3:45pm on Tues, 6 July  Punchbowl  The Broadway Plaza Punchbowl  Between 8:50am-9:50am on Thurs, 8 July  Rockdale  KFC Rockdale  Between 10am-4pm on Tuesday, 6 July and 10.30am-4pm on Wednesday, 7 July  Roselands  Mrs Fields Roselands Shopping Centre  Between 10:30am-10:45am on Wed, 20 June  Roselands Shopping Centre  Between 10:30am-11am on Wed, 30 June, 10:30am-11am on Thurs, 1 July and 7am-11am on Sat, 3 July  Kmart Roselands Shopping Centre  Between 10:45am-11:15am on Sat, 3 July  Coles Roselands Shopping Centre  Between 10:30am-11am on Wed, 30 June, 10:30am-11am on Thurs, 1 July, 7:15am-7:45am on Sat, 3 July and 10:30am-11am on Mon, 5 July  Sylvania  Sushi Hub  Between 2pm — 2:05pm on Sun, 4 July  Ultimo  Broadway Shopping Centre  Between 11:30am-1:30pm on Thurs, 8 July.

One person has also died, the first COVID-19 death of the current outbreak.   NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said that of the 77 new cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Saturday, only 32 were in isolation for the entirety of their infectious period.   The person who died was a southwest Sydney woman in her 90s. She was a close contact of a locally-acquired case and was deemed virus-positive on Saturday.   She is the first person to die since the Bondi cluster emerged on June 16, and the 57th person in NSW to die since the start of the pandemic in early 2020.   The woman is also the first person to catch COVID-19 locally in Australia in 2021 and die.   ""Over 50 of the 77 (cases) are close family members, close family members of those who've been infected,"" Ms Berejiklian told reporters.   ""When you get COVID, unfortunately those most impacted are those closest to you, and tragically we've seen one older person die and I want to extend my deepest condolences to their family and loved ones.""

Points can become both of those things' – An ode to loyalty points,"   In the glorious socially proximate future, when we look back at lockdown we will undoubtedly reflect on its bizarreness.  With most human interactions off the menu, we found excitement where we had never seen it previously.   S ales of sports leggings went through the roof as those more inclined to the sofa became avid exercisers. Going to the post office was no longer an event just for pensioners. The socially acceptable supermarket run became a highlight of the week. The closure of non-essential businesses in lockdown gave the public a severe recreational retail itch that even the centre aisles of Aldi couldn't scratch — when they were open.   While internet retail quickly stepped up to fill the void, what we gained in convenience and safety from online shopping, we lost elsewhere. What was missing — as dedicated shoppers have relished in the weeks since bricks and mortar stores have reopened — was the under-appreciated joy of shopping for items that were neither animal, vegetable nor antiseptic.   Like a thread winding through these transactions leading to a former life are the loyalty points — a retailer-by-retailer tally of what we did in the pandemic. Before Covid-19, rewards were just a bonus. Now they're something else: a little bit of hope for normality, a promise that what's been accumulated from bleach and disinfectant wipes, hand sanitiser and antibacterial soap can be turned into something fun and frivolous, the kind of frivolity that has been altogether absent from the past year.   Pandemics, it transpires, are short on both levity and lipstick. Points, on the other hand, can become both of those things: this week, mine are Chanel No 5 Eau de Parfum and Tom Ford Scarlet Rouge. Next week, they might turn into a free latte or, depending on my level of optimism, a thousandth part of a flight to a far-flung beach.   Rather than a reminder of grim past, points are an IOU of fun to come. Holidays. Restaurants. Parties. Common-or-garden-party excuses to wear a dress. Although the smart money may tell you to spend your points on eminently sensible matters — like your electricity bill — blowing your rewards on the ridiculous after a year of restraint seems like a requisite act of retail rebellion in the spirit of the lifting lockdown.   Some are of course old hands at the loyalty game. Veterans of the scene will often speak in hushed tones about the best deals they've snagged, whether it was a flight to New York paid for by the supermarket shopping or the exquisite hairdryer silently collected over years of Pampers and painkillers purchases. The same group will mutter angrily about those retailers who fail to honour earlier promises, of the dark arts of reward points deflation and the clubs suspiciously downgraded once it comes time to cash in your chips.   Among these veterans, there are myriad strategies on how to best game the system. There are hoarders — heaping points on points for a grand splurge; the ambush-predators who pounce during the sales; and the instant-gratification posse who spend as they go.   As diverse as the collectors are the clubs. Every outlet, from clothing stores to coffee shops and supermarkets to shoe shops, has some form of loyalty club. And, of course, not all loyalty clubs are created equal. As the cognoscenti will tell you, there is a hierarchy of rewards programmes and even awards to recognise the best.   In 2019, the Irish Loyalty Awards was founded by Eileen McGuinness and Marian Kelly. As avid points collectors themselves, they believe a great rewards scheme benefits both customer and business. But who is doing it well?   McGuinness name-checks Aer Lingus's expanded programme. “Before, if you were a regular flier, you would have no problem collecting your miles but if you're someone who was only flying twice a year you would never get your flight because you would never have earned enough points,” she says. “So they went out and got partnerships with Kildare Village and SuperValu and allowed people to earn points with those businesses as well. That made the retrieval more timely, which is important to people.”   Timeliness is essential in both directions — expiry dates are just as crucial.   “ I got supermarket vouchers the other day and I was thinking to myself, ‘Please don't have a best-before date!' This is especially the case now where people aren't shopping as often. Expiry dates are a particular bugbear of mine.”   Although Ireland initially trailed the UK for rewards schemes, we're catching up. The average Irish consumer now holds four loyalty accounts with apps and fobs replacing cards and vouchers as the market matures. In retail, of course, loyalty doesn't mean monogamy and the modern shopper will be participating in a host of schemes, sometimes to the point of amnesia.   Who among us hasn't had a collection of half-stamped coffee clubcards lurking in forgotten corners of jackets and bags — only for us to discover them months or years later?   With so much competition for our loyalty out there how do clubs get us to join? Well, no finicky sign-ups for a start.   “Customers no longer want the hassle of a difficult or convoluted sign-up journey,” says Laura Curley, loyalty partner manager at SuperValu. “The easier the journey, the more successful a loyalty programme will be. Shoppers tell us the first whiff of effort and they're out.”   How about staying on? It seems loyalty clubs with an up-to-date ecosystem have done well. Lockdown has made us more inclined to download apps, perhaps because leaving the house has become its own event.   Innovation isn't just around the infrastructure though; some schemes are breaking the point-for-products paradigm.   Last July, coffee chain Insomnia relaunched its loyalty app to engage with customers during the lockdown. The updated programme offered the same ‘10th free' coffee but changed from collecting points to collecting cash.   “Everyone still wants the free coffee. But now you can see your money building up from zero, with 2c for every euro you spend,” Insomnia head of marketing Fiona O'Doherty says. “From a customer point of view, you see euro, which is a bit more real. And I think people are more conscious of redeeming them, as it's better value.”   While we might grudgingly attend corporate Zoom coffee mornings, there's no doubt we wouldn't grumble about an actual coffee. “Covid-19, if anything, has upped our game. We've added a feature where corporates can gift their staff coffees using a promo code that's sent out to the app. So the employees get a free coffee, and we get a new loyalty customer,” O'Doherty says.   For retailers, hooking us in with a good loyalty club, one that rewards our data exchange with tailored vouchers and allows us to accumulate money over time, is a win-win. For a start, an “engaged” loyalty customer — one who is earning rewards and actively checking for vouchers — can spend as much as 35pc more than a non-loyalty customer. Loyalty clubs can also boost company profits by up to 55pc.   Well, of course. Who hasn't bought something entirely unnecessary because of a voucher prompt? Are you still a sucker if it was a “bargain”? And sure, you might use it again.   That doesn't mean businesses don't need convincing. “I've often been around a table where you'd have c-suite executives,” says McGuinness, referring to the highest managers in a company, “and the managing director might be saying, ‘This loyalty campaign isn't working, I'm getting no return'. But we have clear financial evidence that it is a commercial driver and useful for business.”   How does the customer assess value?   As regards comparing one programme to another, Daragh Cassidy, head of communications of Bonkers.ie , has a handy rule of thumb.   “If you have to spend money to make money, then it's not good value,” he says. “It's like a deal where it's ‘buy two, get one free' or if you have to spend €30 to get a fiver off, that's not a bargain either. If it's something you buy regularly and you get 50pc off, that is a bargain. It's the same principle that applies to sales.”   Cassidy cites rewards schemes with a multiplier effect, particularly SuperValu and Tesco, as offering value. “Some of the energy companies allow you to double up on your voucher. That's not a bad idea. For example, you can get a €5 SuperValu Real Rewards voucher, or you can get €10 off your Electric Ireland bill. Bord Gáis Energy has something similar with Tesco. They're useful.”   However much the pandemic may have changed the retail landscape, it seems that loyalty programmes are as healthy as ever, busily racking up for a post-Covid-19 world. And if in the meantime you can turn hand sanitiser into sunscreen for the summer to come, then that's surely worth being loyal for.

One person has also died, the first COVID-19 death of the current outbreak.   NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said that of the 77 new cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Saturday, only 32 were in isolation for the entirety of their infectious period.   The person who died was a southwest Sydney woman in her 90s. She was a close contact of a locally-acquired case and was deemed virus-positive on Saturday.   She is the first person to die since the Bondi cluster emerged on June 16, and the 57th person in NSW to die since the start of the pandemic in early 2020.   The woman is also the first person to catch COVID-19 locally in Australia in 2021 and die.   ""Over 50 of the 77 (cases) are close family members, close family members of those who've been infected,"" Ms Berejiklian told reporters.   ""When you get COVID, unfortunately those most impacted are those closest to you, and tragically we've seen one older person die and I want to extend my deepest condolences to their family and loved ones.""   There are now 15 COVID-19 patients in NSW in intensive care, with five ventilated.   The NSW treasurer, meanwhile, has acknowledged the state government will need to stump up significantly more financial assistance to businesses and individuals as the likelihood of a long-term Greater Sydney lockdown grows.   He said the NSW government may also make use of federal income support platforms to administer state government-funded financial assistance, if required.   The lockdown of Greater Sydney is due to end on July 16 but both Ms Berejiklian and Treasurer Dominic Perrottet have in recent days admitted it will likely be extended.   Mr Perrottet on Sunday said he expected the lockdown provisions to be extended and this would, in the absence of JobKeeper, cause major damage to businesses and workers.   He said the government would thus be obliged to splash more cash on assistance, and that a second business support package would be announced later this week.   NSW has already spent $1.4 billion on business support amid the current lockdown.   ""Last year there didn't seem to be any light at the end of the tunnel whereas now the vaccine program is rolling out across the state - this gives hope this will hopefully be the last time we have to go through this,"" Mr Perrottet told Sky News.   ""We're going to have to do more, that's just the reality.""   Mr Perrottet was reportedly opposed to the extension of the initial two-week lockdown in Greater Sydney and surrounds due to its effect on business.   NSW Health on Saturday issued numerous alerts for venues of concern across Sydney.   They include Coles at Kareela, a KFC in Rockdale, Penrith Barbeques Galore, a Bunnings in Padstow and a popular cafe in Centennial Park.   The Broadway Shopping Centre in Ultimo posted on social media it had been alerted to a COVID-positive shopper who visited on Thursday.   Several major outlets, including Aldi, Kmart and JB Hi-Fi, were visited by the case and NSW Health on Saturday evening listed the centre as a venue of concern.   As case numbers grow, Ms Berejiklian urged Sydneysiders to adhere to lockdown rules.   After a further update to public health orders, Sydneysiders are now required to wear masks in all indoor areas of construction sites and common areas of apartment blocks.   The new rules come after city-wide restrictions were tightened on Friday afternoon, with exercise now limited to groups of two and only one person per day from each household allowed to leave the house to go shopping.

The exposed venues come as New South Wales recorded 77 new infections on Sunday, with the three-week-long lockdown likely to be extended.   It is the largest surge of daily cases in the state since the first outbreak in March 2020.   Among the most concerning new venues are those inside the usually-packed Broadway Shopping Centre in Glebe, where a Harvey Norman, Aldi, Coles, JB HiFi, Liquorland and Kmart were all visited by an infected person.   Thirty-five venues including several Kmart stores were added to NSW Health's ballooning Covid exposure site list on Sunday night after the state recorded 77 new infections   Four of the new sites are Tier one venues, meaning anyone who visited at the times of concerns are considered close contacts and must get tested immediately and isolate for 14 days regardless of the result.   In Kogarah, they include President Ave Fruit World on Monday 5 July between 11am to 11.15am, the Commonwealth Bank on the same day from 3.05pm to 3.35pm, and Supreme Pizaa on Tuesday 6 July from 3pm to 10pm.   The same advice applied to anyone who visited Greenacre Medical Practice on Monday 5 July between 11.40 to 1.50pm and Tuesday 6 July from 12.40pm to 1.45pm.   Another 31 venues across Sydney were added to the list as casual contact sites on Sunday night as the city's outbreak shifts from the eastern suburbs to the south west.   Two Coles stores – one in Pyrmont and another in Fairfield – were added as casual contact sites on Sunday   Thousands of residents who visited the locations at the times of concerns are advised to immediately get tested and isolate until a negative result is received.   In the inner-city, Pyrmont venues include Bar Zini on Wednesday 7 July from 1pm to 1.15pm and Thursday 8 July from 10am to 10.15am, and Jumbo Thai on the same Thursday from 6.30pm to 7pm.   The local Coles was also affected on Friday 2 July between 6.30pm to 7pm, Tuesday 6 July from 1.45pm to 2pm, and Thursday 8 July from 10.30am to 1.50am.   In the inner-west, six stores inside Glebe's popular Broadway shopping centre became close contact sites over the past week, as well as nearby Budget Petrol in Chippendale on Thursday 8 July between 6.30pm to 7.00pm.   Five of the stores inside the Bay Street plaza were exposed on Thursday 8 July, including Harvey Norman (11.40am – 12.10pm), Kmart (12.15pm-12.30pm), Aldi (12.20pm -1pm), Coles (11.45am-1.30pm) and JB Hi Fi (2pm – 2.45pm).   The JB HI FI was also exposed on Sunday 4 July from 12pm to 12.30pm, while the Liquorland was impacted on the same day from 2.30pm to 3.00pm.   More to follow.

I know because I tried in vain to find yeast and flour for a good three weeks.  By the time grocery shelves returned to a somewhat normal state, I had developed a permanent chip on my shoulder toward the neighbors I saw scurrying about with 20 cans of chicken noodle soup in their carts. But now, supermarkets themselves are doing the stockpiling, loading up on certain products before the grocery biz experiences “some of the highest price increases in recent memory,” The Wall Street Journal reports   © Photo: Scott Olson (Getty Images) Back of shopper standing in front of supermarket butcher counter   WSJ cited Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc., the nation's largest grocery store wholesaler, as an example. The company recently purchased up to 20% more inventory, mainly of shelf-stable packaged foods, in preparation for coming price increases from major companies such as General Mills Inc., Campbell Soup Co., and J.M. Smucker Co. “When you have a uniquely inflationary period like now, it's a feeding frenzy,” said Tony Sarsam, chief executive officer of Michigan-based food retailer and distributor SpartanNash Co.   WSJ explains that supermarket stockpiling is a burden on an already stretched U.S. food supply chain. The grocery industry is struggling with transportation costs, ingredient shortages, and a reduced workforce (at least, at current grocery store wages), which you can read more about here . Interestingly, consumers haven't yet felt the effects of those major price increases, largely because markets are still burning through their stockpiles. While you may notice a slight increase in the cost of some of your pantry staples, retailers are reportedly working to keep prices low to compete against discount or low-price chains like Walmart and Aldi, WSJ reports. But with a barely recovered food supply chain and perhaps permanently altered consumer buying habits, you have to wonder: how much more can our brittle food economy take?
